Simulation of the dining pilosophers problem.

Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of food.
Forks are placed between each pair of philosophers. All day
the philosophers take turns eating and thinking. A philosopher
must have two forks in order to eat, and each fork may only
be used by one philosopher at a time. At any time a philosopher
can pick up or set down the fork on their right or left,
but cannot start eating until picking up both forks.
