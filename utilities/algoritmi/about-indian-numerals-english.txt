Al-Khwarizmi About Indian Numerals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Al-Khwarizmi said: Let us give praise to God, our ruler and defender, worthy of them, that they may render to him the debt, and multiply the praise by increasing; of the Indians by 9 letters, with which they expounded their universal number for the sake of lightness and abbreviation, so that this work would be made easier for those who wanted arithmetic, that is, the greatest number as well as the least, and whatever is in it from multiplication and division, also collection and dispersion, and so on.

2. Al-Khwarizmi said: When I saw that they had set up 9 letters in their universal number, because of the arrangement they had set, I wanted to reveal something about the work that is done through them that would be easier for the learners, if God wills. But if the Indians wanted this, and their intention in these 9 letters was a cause that was clear to me, God directed me to this. If I believe that for another reason, beyond that which I have explained, they have done this through what I have explained, the same reason can be found most certainly and without any doubt. It will gradually become clear to those who look and learn.

3. They therefore made 9 letters, the figure of which is he ... there is also diversity among men in their figures: and this diversity is made in the figure of the fifth letter and the sixth, and also the seventh and eighth. But this is no hindrance. For there are notes that sign the number, and these are the figures in which that diversity is... And I have already made it clear in the book of algebra and almucabalah, that is, of restoration and opposition, that every number is composed, and that every number is composed upon one. Therefore one is found in the universal number; and this is what is said arithmetically in another book. Because the root of every number is one, and it is outside the number. It is the root of a number, therefore every number is found through it. Indeed, it is outside number, therefore it is found by itself, that is, without any other number. But the rest of the number cannot be found without one. For when you say one thing, it does not need another number for its discovery. But the rest of the number needs (sic) one: wherefore you cannot say two or three, unless it precedes one. Number, then, is nothing else but a collection of units; and what we have said, you cannot say two or three, unless it precedes one: we did not say of the voice, that I may say so, but of the matter. For not they may be two or three, if one is taken away. Indeed, one can be without the second or third. Therefore two are nothing else but the duplicity or twinning of one: and likewise three are nothing else but the triplication of the same unity: so understand the rest of the number. Let us now return to the book.

4. I have found, in some algorithms, everything that can be said from a number, and that there is anything that exceeds one up to 9, that is, what is between 9 and one, that is, one is doubled and two are made; and the same one is tripled, and they become three, and so in the rest up to 9. From there 10 are placed in the place of one, and 10 are doubled and tripled, just as it was done with one, and they become 20 from the doubling of hearts, from the tripling 30, and so on until 90. After this, 100 returns in the place of one, and there they are doubled and tripled, as happened with one and 10; and of them 200 and 300 are made, and the rest up to 900. Again a thousand are put in the place of one; and by doubling and tripling, as We have said, 2 thousand are made of them, and 3, and the rest until an infinite number, according to this manner. And I found that they worked from these differences. The first of which is the difference of units, in which whatever is between one and 9 is doubled and tripled. The second difference of tens, in which whatever is from 10 to ninety is doubled and tripled. The third difference of hundreds, in which whatever is from 100 to 900 is doubled or tripled. The fourth is the difference of thousands, in which whatever is from a thousand to 9000 is doubled or tripled. of numbers thus: Every one that was in the superior (sic) difference, will be in the inferior, which is before the 10; that which was 10 in the lower, there will be one in the higher that precedes it; and there will be a beginning of differences on the right hand of the writer: and this will be the first of them, and it is itself placed in units. Now when 10 were spread out in the place of one, and they became a second difference, and their figure was the figure of one, it was necessary for them to have the figure of tens, in that it resembled the figure of one, that they might know by it that they were 10. They therefore proposed to him one difference, and placed in a small circle in the likeness of the letter O, that by this they might know that the difference of the units was empty, and that there was no number in it beyond the small circle which we said occupied it: and it is shown that the number which is in the next difference was tens, and that this would be the second difference, which is the difference of tens. And they put after the circle in the aforesaid second difference whatever they wanted from the number of tens that is between 10 and 90, and these are the figure of the tens: figure 10 is this .... Figure 20 .... And similarly figure 30 is like this, and thus up to 90: of course the circle will be in the first difference, and the character belonging to that number in the second difference. Now this must be known, that he who thus characterizes in the first difference, one thing; in the second thus 10; 100 in the third, and 100 in the fourth. in the second thus 20, and in the third 200, and in the fourth 2000, and so understand the rest. But let us return to the book.
