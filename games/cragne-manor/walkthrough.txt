CONCEPT WARNING

To commemorate the 20th anniversary of Michael Gentry's Anchorhead, we got more than eighty people together and assigned each of them to create one room of a massive Anchorheadesque world. The authors were given basic information about what their rooms were and how they fit into the game's puzzle progression; beyond that, we told them to do whatever they wanted. We didn't tell anybody what was going on in anybody else's rooms.

This resulted in a game that is ridiculous. The world the authors created is inconsistent and often nonsensical. Commands that are necessary to progress in one room might not work anywhere else. Many of the puzzles are, by ordinary human standards, deeply unfair. By ordinary human standards, this is not a good game.

If you approach Cragne Manor as an conventional work of interactive fiction, you'll find it confusing and frustrating. Temper your expectations, be prepared for the weirdness you're diving into. You'll still end up confused and frustrated at some point. Then you'll discover that this is completely worth it.

The cold autumn wind makes you shiver. The train station is eerily deserted: no staff, no other passengers. Even the train you arrived on has disappeared into the distance as if it had never been here. Your memory of the trip already seems faded and unreal, like a dream.

The sign hanging overhead catches your eye: "Backwater Station." Yes: Backwater, Vermont. This is where you need to be. You need to find Peter.

Cragne Manor
An Anchorhead tribute by various authors
Release 10 / Serial number 181208 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N)

Railway Platform (Naomi Hinchen)
The platform is open to the outdoors, but has an overhanging roof with a rusted sign hanging from it. At the back of the platform, to the south, is the entrance to the lobby. Train tracks stretch off into the distance to the east and west; on the other side of the track is a graffitied brick wall. The only other living creature in sight is a rat fixing you with its beady black eyes.

The clock overhead gives the time as 6:20 pm; beneath the clock is a schedule board listing train arrival times. On the platform itself are a wooden bench, a storage locker, and a vending machine.

>x graffiti
Someone has scrawled the word "Vaadignephod" on the wall in lime-green paint.

>x schedule
The board lists a schedule of train times:
Providence     CANCELLED
Dunwich        CANCELLED
Innsmouth      CANCELLED
Anchorhead     13:37
Arkham         CANCELLED

You step in an old wad of gum. Yuck.

>x bench
A weathered wooden bench. On the bench is a familiar gold wristwatch.

>read inscription
On the back of the watch is engraved
N + P
March 19th

>wear watch
(first taking the familiar gold wristwatch)
You put on the familiar gold wristwatch.

Thunder rumbles in the distance.

>x rat
Startled by your attention, the rat scurries away, leaving behind a brass winding key.

>take key
Taken.

>x locker
A storage locker painted a drab industrial gray. Attached to the front are a card swiper and a peeling label reading "Lost and Found."

A leak in the ceiling drips water into a puddle.

>take label
You peel the label off the locker.

>x machine
Similar to a gumball machine, but it's the kind that dispenses toys in little plastic bubbles. At the bottom is a chute where the contents come out. There is a coin slot, but instead of a price next to it, there is a strange squiggled glyph.

In the vending machine is a plastic bubble.

>x glyph
It seems to shift as you look at it, but looks almost like an R fused with a V. Or maybe a J fused with a P? No, it's definitely an R fused with a V.

The clock gives a deep, booming chime on the half hour.

>x bubble
A small transparent plastic capsule with a lid.

In the plastic bubble is a golden eyepiece.

Thunder rumbles in the distance.

>x eyepiece
A misshapen golden disc, studded with lenses. It looks like it could fit flush with your eye socket. On its surfaces are a round button, a triangular button, and a small rectangular slot.

The golden eyepiece is currently switched off.

A leak in the ceiling drips water into a puddle.

>x PA system
The sound emits from a speaker set into the ceiling.

The wind blows stray leaves across the tracks.

>south

Train Station Lobby (Shin)
The evening light trickles through the dirty, cobweb-covered windows on either side of the station exit to the south, dimly illuminating your surroundings. To the north is the platform on which you arrived. To the east, a large mirror decorates the wall next to a green door. To the west, there is a brown door. The overall appearance is one of general neglect and decay. You regard your surroundings with a deep sense of foreboding.

A styrofoam coffee cup sits on the floor next to the entrance to the bathroom.

>take cup
Taken.

>x cup
A half-full styrofoam cup of doubtless very unpleasant coffee that you found on the floor of a train station. It must have had cream in it at some point, because there are definitely some clouds swirling around in there.

>x mirror
You take a long look in the mirror. Even in these dim and dingy surroundings, you are as good-looking as ever.

>x green door
The green door appears to be the entrance to the station office. You try the handle and discover that it is locked.

>x brown door
The brown door leads to the station restroom. Thankfully, you have no need of the facilities at the moment.

>west
(first opening the brown door)

Train Station Restroom (David Petrocco)
As you enter the restroom you hear creak of a faucet being turned off and the rough scraping of metal upon metal from the far end of the restroom. Finally the automatic lights kick on revealing the restroom but there's no sign of who, or what, could have caused the noise.

A harshly lit pay restroom. Dust and grime mar the once white tiles and marble of the facilities: A small shower stall with the curtain closed, a bathroom stall with a single dirty toilet (there are mounts for a door, but it is nowhere to be seen), a small storage closet for janitorial supplies, a four by four row of small lockers, and an extremely dirty dual basin sink.

The train station is EAST.

>x shower
The shower curtain is a stained yellow sheet of plastic covering the entrance.

While examining the shower you hear the loud WOOOSH of a toilet flushing behind you.

>open curtain
You open the train station shower.

>x shower
The shower is covered in fresh droplets of dirty brown water, as if someone had just recently turned it on after months of neglect. Small droplets of water drip from the shower head to the floor below.

>x sink
The train station restroom sink is currently switched off.

>turn on sink
As you turn on the sink it begins to shake violently.

>turn off sink
The shaking subsides as soon as you turn off the sink.

>x toilet
The toilet is filled with a murky brown, and foul smelling, water. The surface of the water ripples as the toilet finishes flushing.

The loud crash of something falling near the closet door shatters the silence of the bathroom along with what's left of your nerve.

>x closet
A small storage closet where several shelves have collaped, their supports seemingly rotten away, and have buried what appears to be a long wooden handled tool, a mop or broom perhaps.

A small note taped to the wall says Locker 3 7113.

>x supplies
You're already undergoing one monumental task, you don't need to give yourself another trying to clean this hellish mess.

>x lockers
Sixteen lockers in a four by four pattern. The few that still have doors are flung open and battered, save for one still secured by a large combination lock, the kind that you can set to a four-digit number.

>set lock to 7113
The lock slides open. You remove it from the hinges of the locker and open it to find a glass jar containing an insect.

>take glass jar
Taken.

>x insect
A clear glass jar containing a hideous green insect. It's either dead or doing a very good job of playing dead and you have no desire to find out which. The number of legs and eyes appear to change every time you look at it.

It currently has ten legs and five eyes.

>x insect
A clear glass jar containing a hideous green insect. It's either dead or doing a very good job of playing dead and you have no desire to find out which. The number of legs and eyes appear to change every time you look at it.

It currently has ten legs and eight eyes.

>x insect
A clear glass jar containing a hideous green insect. It's either dead or doing a very good job of playing dead and you have no desire to find out which. The number of legs and eyes appear to change every time you look at it.

It currently has twelve legs and seven eyes.

>east

Train Station Lobby (Shin)
The surroundings are as dim and dingy as ever. The platform is to the north. The dirty, cobweb-covered windows and the station exit are to the south. The large mirror and the green door are to the east. The restroom door is to the west. You are unsure what you should do.

>south

Exterior of Train Station (Emily Short with additions from Graham Nelson)
To the north is the massive windowless bulk of the train station. A metal trash can squats beneath its carved facade. The town itself is downhill, on the other side of a ravine. Somewhere down there, you can get a bath and a meal.

A woman stands in the center of the bridge, preventing traffic in both directions.

>x station
It is at least three stories tall, with no exterior windows. Carved on the outside are a series of figures, as though it were the outside of Notre Dame.

Positioned in front is a trash can.

>x figures
Sculpted men and women, very muscular, engage in the work of building a train station. Most carry blocks of stone on their backs. Overseeing them is an inhuman figure carrying a whip.

>x sky
The clouds are gutteral, lightless, and tinged with green.

>x can
It is a closed metal can from which issues an unknowable stink.

>open can
You open the trash can and peer into its stygian depths. Within you discern a pull-string doll and a dog-eared book.

>take all from can
pull-string doll: Taken.

a dog-eared book: Taken.

>x doll
The doll has an inane smile on its face and a pull-string in the middle of its back.

It has the sort of head with two faces, one of which is hidden by its hair. Rotate the head and the other face will be forward.

>pull string
The doll chirps, "I like the train tracks! Parallel! Yay!"

There is a tinny sound of applause.

>pull string
The doll chirps, "I like the glass jar containing an insect! Hideous! Yay!"

There is a tinny sound of applause.

>pull string
The doll chirps, "I like the bridge! Antediluvian! Yay!"

There is a tinny sound of applause.

>x book
A dog-eared, stained paperback called The Modern Girl's Divination Handbook -- Volume Three. The cover features three teenage girls of varying ethnicities laughing over the body of a dead cow, each one holding a section of entrails. Reading the blurb on the back makes you suspect that the authors used up all of the more normal divination methods in volumes one and two, and are now scraping the barrel for the really weird stuff.

>read book
You flip past the title page, looking for something interesting...

Corn on the Cob Castings
If your parents are anything like our parents, they really suck at predicting the future... but they might have a kernel of truth for you! The next time you're at a family barbecue, slip this potion into your mom's potato salad, then wait for her to finish her corn on the cob--

What.

[You can continue to READ the divination handbook; this is excerpt 1/3.]

>read book
You continue to thumb through the book...

Teddy Rux-Possession
Did you learn about history from a creepy animatronic bear when you were a kid, and now he's just gathering dust? Good news! With a little bit of sage smudging and energy cleansing, Teddy Ruxpin makes the perfect home for a wandering spirit--

Nope nope nope.

[You can continue to READ the divination handbook; this is excerpt 2/3.]

The sky is oppressively tenebrous.

>read book
You flip past a lot of terrible ideas to the very last page of the book...

Coffee Scrying
Ever wonder if the little heart in your latte means the barista's crushing on you? Well, now you can find out for sure! All you need is a cold cup of coffee with some cream in it--

Huh. Unlike everything else in the book, this seems like it might actually prove useful. There aren't that many possible readings, so you quickly memorize them and slam the book closed.

[This is the end of the divination handbook, but if you have no respect for your own intelligence, you can READ it again.]

>x coffee
The swirls in your cup form a perfect fern, just like in a fancy latte. Botanical images mean that while there is much left to accomplish in the present situation, your immediate environment sustains you, and you have everything that you need.

>x ravine
It is hard to guess the depth. At one moment it seems no more than a story, and at the next measureless. Water must have carved this ravine, but not much is in evidence now. A thin trickle runs at the distant bottom of the chasm.

>x woman
She is wearing a long red scarf and a tattered skirt. Her hair is wild, grey in the same color as the train tracks, twisted by the wind. She keeps shooting uncomfortable glances at the town.

>x scarf
An angry scarlet, which indicates a greater than human vitality and vigor.

>x skirt
Tattered, prehistoric, a garment belonging to a previous century, when women in these parts were frequently burned.

The sky above is an inhuman green tint.

>x bridge
The bridge is built of immense blocks, primeval beyond measure. It offers only a narrow crossing.

>x town
Uniformly grey and brown. Perhaps it is the weather, but even the church steeple looks dusty.

>south
The woman gets in your way. "If you're here for a holiday, you've made a serious mistake, fool," she says. It sounds like she means it.

>ask woman about town
She says, "Surely even you can see its nature, uneducated fool."

>ask woman about herself
The woman replies, "I was summoned here to protect you, and those like you."

>ask woman about station
"The train station has been here a long time, in many different guises, idiot."

>ask woman about Peter
She says, "You'll do best in this town if you ask least."

>turn head
You rotate the doll's head. Its alternate face appears, scowling fiercely.

>pull string
A voice comes from within the doll's body, squamous and gravelly: "Avoid the plague of the glass jar containing an insect! Green is the tint of poison and untamed growth! It is displeasing to the eye!"

The woman looks alarmed.

>show jar to woman
The woman goes white. From behind you on the tracks comes a curious noise, mechanical and screeching, as though something were coming along the tracks. When you turn back, the woman has gone.

>south
You pass over the bridge.

Milkweed (Caleb Wilson)
It is possible to feel claustrophobia out of doors. Sunlight fills the sky but somehow doesn't reach you here. Steep banks of bramble rise to the east and west, trapping you within a gloomy trough a dozen yards wide. A poorly-surfaced road leads north and south along the trough's nadir. Just west of it, camouflaged with rust, is the train track.

A tremendous patch of milkweed, the stems abnormally thick and tall, grows on the east side of the road beneath the thorn bank.

A giant milkweed leaf dangles just within reach from the mass of stems.

Almost hidden within the milkweed is a dilapidated shack built more of splinters than of planks.
