South Lawn
You are on a wide lawn just north of the entrance to the Robner estate. Directly
north at the end of a pebbled path is the Robner house, flanked to the northeast
and northwest by a vast expanse of well-kept lawn. Beyond the house can be seen
the lakefront.

>north


Front Path
You are at the Robners' front door, which is closed.
You can walk around the house from here to the east or west. To the south a
rolling lawn leads to the entrance of the estate.

>open door


The front door is now open.

>north


Mrs. Robner appears, walking down a hallway from the north.
"Hello," she says, "I'm Mrs. Robner. Please come in. I'm afraid I really can't
help you much. This is surely a terrible waste of time, not to mention
upsetting, having all these police marching around the house. This has been a
trying time, as I suppose you can understand. As I told Mr. Coates and the other
detective, you may look around but you must be out by 8 o'clock at the latest.
Oh, I almost forgot...Mr. Coates will be reading my husband's will at noon in
the living room. You may attend if you wish.""I'm going to make myself some
breakfast now. I'll be around all day if you need anything. I'll do what I can
to help. Good day!"
Foyer
This is the foyer of the Robner house, beautifully appointed with a fine crystal
chandelier, marble floors, and a large marble-topped table. The front door, to
the south, is closed. The foyer continues north.
Mrs. Robner heads off to the north.

>north


North of Foyer
This is a hallway north of the foyer. To the west is an open doorway, and to the
east is the foot of a staircase. The hall continues north.
Mrs. Robner heads off to the north.

>east


Bottom of Stairs
You are at the foot of the stairs to the second floor. Open archways lead west
and south.

>up


Stairs
You are on a landing halfway up the flight of stairs. You notice that the stairs
do indeed make quite a noise when stepped upon.

>up


Top of Stairs
You are at the top of the staircase where short hallways run north and south and
a corridor the length of the house heads west.

>west


Hallway
You are just west of the staircase. There are doors on both sides (north and
south) of the hallway, which continues west. Both doors are closed.

>west


Hallway
This is approximately the middle of the corridor, a convenient place for a
closet full of linens. Stairs to the east and a window to the west are about
equidistant. The closet, to the north, is open and rather shallow.

>west


Hallway
This section of hallway is near the west end. Through the window at the end of
the hall you can see some trees and the lake beyond. The hallway continues east
and west, and a door to the south is closed.

>west


End of Hallway
This is the west end of the upstairs hall. To the north is the library, where
Mr. Robner was found. Its solid oak door has been knocked down and is lying just
inside the entrance to the library. A window which cannot be opened is at the
end of the hallway.

>north
Library
This is the library where Mr. Robner's body was found. It is decorated in a
simple but comfortable style. Mr. Robner obviously spent a great deal of time
here. A wide executive desk sits before tall balcony windows which lie at the
north of the room. A telephone is sitting on the desk. The east side of the room
is composed of three large bookshelf units containing numerous volumes on many
topics. The floor is carpeted from wall to wall. The massive oak door which
blocked the entrance has been forcibly knocked off its hinges and is lying by
the doorway.
A pencil is lying on the floor near the desk.
Beside the desk is a large collapsible tray.
Sitting on the tray is a bowl containing a white powdery substance.
Alongside the desk is a wicker wastepaper basket.
The wastepaper basket contains:
  A bunch of crumpled papers
Lying on the floor, overturned, is a beautiful saucer.
Turned onto its side, lying on the floor, is a beautiful teacup.
Lying atop the desk is a pad of white note paper.
A desk calendar is here, open to July 7.
There is a bottle of Ebullion here.

The carpet is an expensive affair, and quite clean, except for a few small areas
of dried mud in the vicinity of the desk. There are no other stains or markings
that you can see.

It is open to July 8.
There is only one notation here, in the 9AM spot: "Call Coates: Will completed".

>open balcony door


The balcony door is now open.

>north


Library Balcony
The balcony is bare of furniture, though it has a beautiful view of the rose
garden, the north lawn and the lake. A metal railing around the balcony
prevents an accidental drop to the thorny roses below. The window between the
balcony and the library is open.
Away to the north, Mr. McNabb can be seen mowing the grass.

>examine railing


The railing is made of a sturdy metal and helps prevent nasty falls. There is a
small area of paint scraped off the outside edge.

East Lawn
You are on a neatly manicured lawn, east of the house, which extends north and
east to the shore of a lake. To the northwest is a peaceful orchard, and toward
the south another wide lawn. Southeast, beside the lake, is a small shed with a
solitary dirty window.
Mr. McNabb is off to the northwest.

Orchard Path
You are on a path at the edge of a small orchard of fruit trees which abuts the
eastern side of the back of the house. The orchard is obviously intended more to
display the beauty of the blossoms in spring than to produce significant amounts
of fruit. The windows of the kitchen look out onto the orchard, although your
view of them is blocked by the trees and a small grape arbor. To the west is a
path along a rose garden, and lawns sweep out to the north and east.
Mr. McNabb is off to the west.

>west


Garden Path
You are at the edge of a large rose garden, meticulously maintained by the
gardener, Mr. McNabb. He is said to be exceedingly proud of this particular
garden, which is the envy of the neighbors. Rows of roses are neatly arranged
and the sweet fragrance of the flowers is worth a trip here in itself. An
orchard to the east contains many varieties of fruit trees and wide lawns lie to
the west and north. The roses themselves are to the south, filling the area
between you and the back of the house.
Mr. McNabb is here, cutting fresh flowers. He seems quite worked up and is
talking aloud to himself.

>hey McNabb


Mr. McNabb is facing you.

>what is wrong


(said to Mr. McNabb)
He tells you his story. He was tending to the roses this morning when he noticed
two deep holes in the garden, with a few roses crushed nearby. He doesn't know
when he'll be able to repair the damage.

>show me the holes


(said to Mr. McNabb)
"Follow me!" he says, and starts walking toward the roses.
Mr. McNabb heads off to the south.

>follow him


Among the Roses
You are among rows of roses. The ground is soft, and your footsteps leave a
rather bad impression as many poor seedlings are trampled underfoot. A safer
place to admire the flowers lies to the north. A window to the south allows a
view into the house.
There is no way into the house from here.
McNabb grabs your arm and leads you to a spot deep within the garden and near
the house. You might never have found this place alone. He points at the ground,
where you see two holes in the soft earth.
Mr. McNabb heads off to the north.

>examine holes


There are two holes here, each about two inches by four inches. They are at
least three inches deep and the soil is compacted around them.

>examine ground


Ouch! You cut your finger on a sharp edge as you dig. You search carefully in
the dirt, now that you are sure something is there, and pull up a piece of
porcelain, covered with dirt and dried mud.

>dig around holes


Aside from dirt, organic fertilizer, and small crawly creatures, you turn up
nothing but roses.

>analyze fragment for loblo


Sergeant Duffy walks up as quietly as a mouse. He takes the fragment from you.
"I'll return soon with the results," he says, and leaves as silently as he
entered.

Living Room
This is a large and impressive room, whose furnishings bespeak the great
personal wealth of the Robners. The south side of the room is a large bay
window, now closed, which looks out onto the front yard.
A wood pile sits beside a huge fieldstone fireplace. A double doorway leading to
the main hall is the only exit. Pictures of Mrs. Robner's colonial ancestors
line one wall. The room contains formal seating for at least fifteen people, in
several groups of chairs and couches. Tables and cabinets, all of the finest
mahogany and walnut, complete the furnishings. On one of the tables is a
telephone.
Ms. Dunbar is sitting on the sofa here.
Mrs. Robner is sitting here, knitting.

Do you want to keep waiting? (Y/N) >yes
Mr. Coates steps into the room.
Mr. Coates shakes your hand. "I'm glad you're here, Inspector. We'll begin the
reading soon."
Mr. Coates begins: "This is an awkward situation. Mr. Robner told me five days
ago that he wanted to execute a new will, and promised to call me when it was
completed. As I never heard from him, I must assume that he either changed his
mind or did not complete the new will. Therefore, the one in my possession must
be considered the most recent testament."
From the corner of your eye, you catch George nodding his head, as if in
approval, and smiling broadly.
Continuing, Mr. Coates says: "Naturally, should a more recent will exist and be
found within a reasonable period, the present one will be voided. I will proceed
with reading the will here in my hands, which was executed three years ago last
month." He reads the will, simply written and direct, leaving equal parts of the
estate to his son, George Arthur Robner, and his wife, Mrs. Leslie Phillips
Robner.
There is some discussion, understated congratulations and overstated sympathy,
which Mr. Coates cuts short by clearing his throat. "I must leave now, I'm
afraid. If you have any questions, I can be contacted tomorrow." He picks up the
phone, dials his office, and asks to be picked up at the Robner estate.
Mr. Coates, for whom you are waiting, has arrived.



It is now 11:57 am.

"I...uh...I don't really know what to say. I guess that Dad...but there is no

Sergeant Duffy seems to arrive from nowhere, holding the fragment in his hands.
"The fragment did contain LoBlo. Here is the full report." He hands you a slip
of paper, and departs.
Do you want to keep waiting? (Y/N) >yes


George walks purposefully toward the bookshelves. He looks around, but you react
before he can see you. When you peek out again, George is fiddling with the
shelves. His right arm reaches into the shelf and, to your amazement, the unit
of bookshelves on the left rotates away from the wall, revealing a darkened room
behind. George enters it, trembling with barely controlled fear and excitement.
Do you want to keep waiting? (Y/N) >yes


A dim light in the hidden closet comes on. In the faint light, you can see
George motioning with his right hand. All at once, the shelf swings shut!

The shelves contain many books and manuscripts covering a wide range of
subjects. They are meticulously arranged.
One book is out of place, however, leaving a gap in one row. On closer
inspection, a small black button can be seen at the back of this gap.

>press button


The leftmost shelf quietly swings out against the balcony window.
As the shelf swings open, George spins to face you. His expression, first
seemingly wild with happiness, changes to one of panic and horror. He jerks
around, trying feebly to conceal a piece of paper in his hands. He jumps toward
you, then recoils in fear. Finally, sobbing, he crumples to the floor, clutching
the paper beneath him. A large combination safe, imbedded in a wall, is lying
open. You enter the hidden closet.
Hidden Closet
This is a secret room situated between the library and the master bedroom. The
room is bare and somewhat dusty, as if it were not often used. An unmarked
switchplate surrounds two buttons, one blue and one red. A formidable safe is
embedded in the south wall. The heavy safe door is wide open.
The library can be seen through a door to the west.

Leafing through these papers, it becomes obvious that they incriminate Mr.
Baxter in wrongdoings regarding the Focus scandal. They document funds which
were embezzled by Baxter and tell how the scandal was hushed up. This evidence

There is a flicker of surprise on Baxter's face. "I'm not sure what you mean.
Focus Corporation has been a subsidiary of Robner Corp. for some years. I fail
to see its import."

>show papers to Baxter


He reads slowly and leafs through the pages. "I'm afraid I haven't been entirely
candid with you. There was some trouble a few years ago with Focus Corp. because
of some, let us say, irresponsible dealings on my part. Marshall agreed to cover
up my involvement to save the company any bad publicity."

>show lab report to Dunbar


She seems stunned but recovers quickly. "He didn't commit suicide, then?" she
says. "But LoBlo, that's a pill I take for my blood pressure." She pauses. "I
can tell what you're thinking, but I didn't, couldn't have done it. Why should
I? Someone must have taken them, maybe George. He knew I used them."

Baxter studies the report carefully. "This is quite peculiar. It appears that
Marshall was murdered. I wonder...I would have a word with George if I were you,
Inspector."

ask her along to my subscription series. I really should have told the other

Text of a letter from Police Commissioner Klutz dated September 5:

Dear Inspector,

    Congratulations on your superb handling of the Robner case. As you have
probably heard, a jury convicted Mr. Baxter and Ms. Dunbar today of the murder
of Mr. Robner. Thanks to you, the murderers will be behind bars, possibly for
the rest of their lives. Thanks for a job brilliantly done. Which reminds me of
another fascinating case I would like to assign you to...

Coming soon: Another INTERLOGIC Mystery from Infocom

You have solved the case! If you would like, you may see the author's summary of
the story. We would advise you to come up with your own first! Would you like to
see the author's summary? (Y/N) >yes
Mr. Robner's work was his life, as pointed out by a number of the principals.
George knew that his father had lost control of the company, and a story in the
newspaper indicated that Baxter intended to sell the company to a multi-national
conglomerate, presumably to advance his career. Baxter admitted to the merger
plans, but indicated that Mr. Robner was in complete agreement. This is contrary
to what George and Mrs. Robner said. The note pad found in the library was
Robner's last, desperate attempt to save the company, in which Robner threatened
to expose Baxter's involvement in the Focus scandal. Baxter denied getting the
note, but it was not in the trash. The papers detailing Baxter's criminality in
the scandal were kept locked in a safe in a hidden closet near the library. Only
George and Marshall Robner knew the whereabouts of the safe.
  Baxter planned to murder his partner, aided by the fact that Robner was known
to be depressed, even suicidal. He enlisted the help of his lover, Dunbar, one
of whose medicines was found to interact fatally with the pills Robner was
taking. The relationship of Baxter and Dunbar was kept quiet, although Mrs.
Rourke had an inkling of it. After the concert in Hartford which both Baxter and
Dunbar attended, they returned to the Robner estate. Dunbar placed some LoBlo in
Robner's tea. After Robner died, Baxter used the ladder from the shed to enter
the library and exchange the incriminating cup for a clean one (counting the
china in the kitchen reveals that a cup is missing). Coming down the ladder,

Baxter presumably dropped the cup and inadvertently left one piece on the ground
in the rose garden, near the ladder holes that McNabb found while tending his
roses.
