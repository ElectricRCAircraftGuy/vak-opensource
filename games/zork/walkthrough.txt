West of House
You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front
door.
There is a small mailbox here.

You are empty-handed.

Opening the small mailbox reveals a leaflet.

(Taken)
"WELCOME TO ZORK!

ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning. In it you will explore
some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortals. No computer should be
without one!"

>drop leaflet

Dropped.

>go south

South of House
You are facing the south side of a white house. There is no door here, and all
the windows are boarded.

>go east

Behind House
You are behind the white house. A path leads into the forest to the east. In one
corner of the house there is a small window which is slightly ajar.

>open window

With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow entry.

>enter house

Kitchen
You are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used
recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark
staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east
is a small window which is open.
On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.
A bottle is sitting on the table.
The glass bottle contains:
  A quantity of water

>go west

Living Room
You are in the living room. There is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with
strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy
case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.
Above the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.
A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.

>take lamp

Taken.

>move rug

With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room, revealing the
dusty cover of a closed trap door.

>open trap door

The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending into
darkness.

>turn on lamp

The brass lantern is now on.

>go down

The trap door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.

Cellar
You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading north, and a
crawlway to the south. On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is
unclimbable.

>go south

East of Chasm
You are on the east edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be seen. A
narrow passage goes north, and the path you are on continues to the east.

>go east

Gallery
This is an art gallery. Most of the paintings have been stolen by vandals with
exceptional taste. The vandals left through either the north or west exits.
Fortunately, there is still one chance for you to be a vandal, for on the far
wall is a painting of unparalleled beauty.

>take painting

Taken.

>go north

Studio
This appears to have been an artist's studio. The walls and floors are
splattered with paints of 69 different colors. Strangely enough, nothing of
value is hanging here. At the south end of the room is an open door (also
covered with paint). A dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace;
although you might be able to get up it, it seems unlikely you could get back
down.
Loosely attached to a wall is a small piece of paper.

>go up chimney

Kitchen
On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.
A bottle is sitting on the table.
The glass bottle contains:
  A quantity of water

>go up

Attic
This is the attic. The only exit is a stairway leading down.
A large coil of rope is lying in the corner.
On a table is a nasty-looking knife.

>take knife

Taken.

>take rope

The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending into
darkness.

The trap door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.

Cellar
Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.

>go north

The Troll Room
This is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole
leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the
walls.
A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the
room.
Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.
The axe crashes against the rock, throwing sparks!

>kill troll with sword

The fatal blow strikes the troll square in the heart:  He dies.
Almost as soon as the troll breathes his last breath, a cloud of sinister black
fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass has disappeared.
Your sword is no longer glowing.

>drop sword

Dropped.

>go east

East-West Passage
This is a narrow east-west passageway. There is a narrow stairway leading down
at the north end of the room.

>go east

Round Room
This is a circular stone room with passages in all directions. Several of them
have unfortunately been blocked by cave-ins.
