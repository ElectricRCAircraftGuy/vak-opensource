You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling along a rocky bed.

>south


At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit in the
rock. Downstream the streambed is bare rock.

>south


You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt. Set into the dirt is a
strong steel grate mounted in concrete. A dry streambed leads into the
depression.

>unlock grate with keys

You unlock the steel grate.

>down

(first opening the grate)


You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to the surface. A low crawl
over cobbles leads inward to the west.

The grate stands open.

>west


You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage. There is a dim light at the east
end of the passage.

There is a small wicker cage discarded nearby.

>light lamp

You switch the brass lantern on.

>get cage

Taken.

>west


You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface. A low
wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris here, but an
awkward canyon leads upward and west.

A note on the wall says, "Magic word XYZZY."

A three foot black rod with a rusty star on one end lies nearby.

>west


You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.

>west


You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high. The walls are frozen rivers of
orange stone. An awkward canyon and a good passage exit from east and west sides
of the chamber.

A cheerful little bird is sitting here singing.

>get bird

You catch the bird in the wicker cage.

>west


At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist. A west passage ends
here except for a small crack leading on.

Rough stone steps lead down the pit.

>down


You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to the west.
There are openings to either side. Nearby, a wide stone staircase leads
downward. The hall is filled with wisps of white mist swaying to and fro almost
as if alive. A cold wind blows up the staircase. There is a passage at the top
of a dome behind you.

Rough stone steps lead up the dome.

[Your score has just gone up by twenty-five points.]

>west



The body of a huge green dead dragon is lying off to one side.

>north


You are in a secret N/S canyon above a large room.

>down


You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is an immense slab fallen
from the ceiling (slab room). East and west there once were large passages, but
they are now filled with boulders. Low small passages go north and south, and
the south one quickly bends west around the boulders.

>south


You are at the west end of the twopit room. There is a large hole in the wall
above the pit at this end of the room.

>down


You are at the bottom of the western pit in the twopit room. There is a large
hole in the wall about 25 feet above you.
There is a tiny little plant in the pit, murmuring "Water, water, ..."

>pour water

(on the plant)
The plant spurts into furious growth for a few seconds.

There is a 12-foot-tall beanstalk stretching up out of the pit, bellowing
"Water!! Water!!"

>up


The top of a 12-foot-tall beanstalk is poking out of the west pit.

>west



>up



>north


You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across. The floor is covered by
white mist seeping in from the north. The walls extend upward for well over 100
feet. Suspended from some unseen point far above you, an enormous two-sided
mirror is hanging parallel to and midway between the canyon walls.

A small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.

The mirror is obviously provided for the use of the dwarves, who as you know,
are extremely vain.

>north


You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir. An opaque cloud of white
mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward. The lake is fed by a stream, which
tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet overhead and splashes noisily
into the water somewhere within the mist. The only passage goes back toward the
south.

>get water

The bottle is now full of water.

>south



The mirror is obviously provided for the use of the dwarves, who as you know,

There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you. As you turn toward
them, you spot a bearded pirate. He is carrying a large chest.

"Shiver me timbers!" he cries, "I've been spotted! I'd best hie meself off to
the maze to hide me chest!"

With that, he vanishes into the gloom.

There is a gigantic beanstalk stretching all the way up to the hole.

>up


There is a huge beanstalk growing out of the west pit up to the hole.

>east


You are at the east end of the twopit room. The floor here is littered with thin
rock slabs, which make it easy to descend the pits. There is a path here
bypassing the pits to connect passages from east and west. There are holes all
over, but the only big one is on the wall directly over the west pit where you
can't get to it.
There is a huge beanstalk growing out of the west pit up to the hole.

>down


You are at the bottom of the eastern pit in the twopit room. There is a small

it. Cavernous passages lead east, north, and south. On the west wall is scrawled
the inscription, "Fee fie foe foo" [sic].

There is a large nest here, full of golden eggs!

>north


You are at one end of an immense north/south passage.

The way north is barred by a massive, rusty, iron door.

gently sloping passage leads upward to the north, another passage leads se, and
a hands and knees crawl leads west.

You can see a ming vase here.

>north


You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a large cavern. Far
below, through a heavy white mist, strange splashing noises can be heard. The
mist rises up through a fissure in the ceiling. The path exits to the south and
west.

>west


You are in an alcove. A small northwest path seems to widen after a short
distance. An extremely tight tunnel leads east. It looks like a very tight
squeeze. An eerie light can be seen at the other end.

joins a higher crawl from the east to make a walking passage going west. There
is also a large room above. The air is damp here.

>north


You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock. The floor and walls are
littered with bits of shells imbedded in the stone. A shallow passage proceeds
downward, and a somewhat steeper one leads up. A low hands and knees passage
enters from the south.
There is an enormous clam here with its shell tightly closed.

>open clam with trident

A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away. Goodness, this must
really be an oyster. (I never was very good at identifying bivalves.) Whatever
it is, it has now snapped shut again.

>down


You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.

Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate! "Har, har," he
chortles. "I'll just take all this booty and hide it away with me chest deep in
the maze!" He snatches your treasure and vanishes into the gloom.

>wait
Time passes.

The sepulchral voice intones, "The cave is now closed." As the echoes fade,
there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange smoke). . .

As your eyes refocus, you look around...


You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the giant
room. It appears to be a repository for the "Adventure" program. Massive torches
far overhead bathe the room with smoky yellow light. Scattered about you can be
seen a pile of bottles (all of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks
murmuring quietly, a bed of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on
their ends, and a collection of brass lanterns. Off to one side a great many
dwarves are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly. A sign nearby reads: "Do not
disturb the dwarves!"

An immense mirror is hanging against one wall, and stretches to the other end of
the room, where various other sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the
distance.



Your lamp is here, gleaming brightly.
There is an enormous oyster here with its shell tightly closed.

You can also see a black rod with a rusty star on the end and a small bottle
(which is empty) here.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

>sw
You are at the southwest end of the repository. To one side is a pit full of
fierce green snakes. On the other side is a row of small wicker cages, each of
which contains a little sulking bird. In one corner is a bundle of black rods
with rusty marks on their ends. A large number of velvet pillows are scattered
about on the floor. A vast mirror stretches off to the northeast. At your feet
is a large steel grate, next to which is a sign which reads, "TREASURE VAULT.
Keys in main office."

An immense mirror is hanging against one wall, and stretches to the other end of
the room, where various other sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the
distance.

A cheerful little bird is sitting here singing.

The grate is closed.

A three foot black rod with a rusty mark on one end lies nearby.

You can also see a velvet pillow here.

>blast

There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far wall,
burying the dwarves in the rubble. You march through the hole and find yourself
in the main office, where a cheering band of friendly elves carry the conquering
adventurer off into the sunset.
