                 is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind
                 of fear is fear of the unknown.

November, 1997.

You take a deep breath of salty air as the first raindrops begin to spatter the
pavement, and the swollen, slate-colored clouds that blanket the sky mutter
ominous portents amongst themselves over the little coastal town of Anchorhead.

Squinting up into the glowering storm, you wonder how everything managed to
happen so fast. The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer claiming
to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family, was
bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of planning and
decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing up and shipping
away of your entire home, your entire life...

Now suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight, over a
thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting ready to move
into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far removed that not even
Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only been married since June and none
of this was any of your idea in the first place, and already it's starting to
rain.

These days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.

You shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head, trying to
focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate agent and pick
up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town to take care of
some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up in a few minutes,
and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious process of settling in.

A sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder
-- fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones. Shouldn't it be
snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh, you open your
umbrella.

Welcome to Anchorhead...

                              * THE FIRST DAY *

              I was far from home, and the spell of the eastern
              sea was upon me.

Outside the Real Estate Office
A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle
of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of
Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and
leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office,
which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the
west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.

You are wearing your wedding ring, your trenchcoat and your clothes; in
addition, you have in your hand your umbrella.

The pockets of your trenchcoat are empty.

 Alley                                               day one

Alley
This narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of
rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick
walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a
tall, wooden fence.

High up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style
window.

>push can against wall
 Alley                                               day one

Grunting and holding your breath, you manhandle one of the filthy cans under the
window.

In the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting
on the wind.

Overhead, the swollen clouds flicker ominously with a greenish haze of sheet
lightning.

>climb can
 Alley, on the garbage can                           day one

You clamber onto the wobbling garbage can, precariously balanced. You can just

It's a tight squeeze, but you just manage to wriggle through, dropping quietly
to the floor inside.

Peering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of filing
cabinets lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A window high up on the
south wall lets in a very faint illumination.

Office
Pallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted,
papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and
the file room lies east.

Sitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering
machine.

Someone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.

 Office                                              day one

For a while there is nothing but a quiet hiss, followed by intermittent skirls
of strange-sounding static. It sounds like one of those annoying glitches where
the caller hangs up but the machine keeps recording anyway. Then, barely audible
through the static, you detect what sounds like a human voice whispering a
single word:

"Verlac."

The machine beeps.

A brief shudder ripples up your back. You remember now, "Verlac" is the name of
this branch of Michael's family.

Strange; the file on the Verlac property has been cleaned out. Title, deed, all
the papers, all of it gone. There is, however, a set of keys tucked down in the
hanging folder. You quickly pocket them.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

 Narrow Street                                       day one

Narrow Street
As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged
rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the
south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and
a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the
north leads down to the local watering hole.

>west
 Junction                                            day one

Junction
To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a
country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the
east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make
out the vaulted rooftops of the university.

>nw
 University Court                                    day one

University Court
Isolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University
represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural
achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and
enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further
into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for
its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most
extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer
Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage
and his plans to move into the estate. Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they
take care of their own.

There are numerous buildings surrounding this cobbled court, but the only one
you are interested in is the library to the west, where Michael told you he'd be
until he came back to the real estate agent's office to pick you up. Which,
incidentally, he has not yet done.

>west
 Library                                             day one

You close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.

Library
Shadows roost thickly in the vaulted ceiling, and small, green-shaded desk lamps
cast pools of warm radiance here and there around the library's dim interior.
You pause a moment to let the hushed peacefulness of this place soak in -- a
welcome relief from the unsettling events of the day. An exit lies east, and a
small alcove to the north houses the circulation counter.

Peering through the shadows, you spot your husband sitting at one of the reading
desks, absorbed in some sort of weighty tome and clearly oblivious to the time.

>read book
 Library                                             day one

Michael looks up, startled, then realizes it's you and smiles. "Hi, hon," he
says, closing the book and stretching. Then he glances at his watch. "Good
grief, what happened to the time? I'm so sorry -- I just lost track." He smiles
sheepishly.

"Well?" he asks. "Did you get the keys?"

>show keys to Michael
 Library                                             day one

"Great!" says Michael. "You hang on to that. Just a second, I'll put this back."
He takes the book up to the circulation desk and hands it to the librarian.
"Okay then," he says, returning, "let's go."

Michael suddenly smacks his forehead. "Oh, crap, I forgot to tell you. The car
broke down." He spreads his hands. "I don't know what happened to it; one second
I'm parking outside, the next second it dies and I can't get it started again. I
called a tow truck, but the nearest garage is up in Arkham. They picked it up
but won't be able to look at it until next week at the earliest. Anyway, it
looks like we'll have to walk back to the house." He offers you a lame smile.
"You can hold the umbrella."

Your score has just gone up by two points.

As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged
rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the
south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and
a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the
north leads down to the local watering hole.

Michael strolls along after you.

"We really should be getting on to the house, don't you think?" asks Michael.
"It's a bit rainy out."

>south
 Whateley Bridge                                     day one

Whateley Bridge
A hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is
possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans
the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south
halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its
underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each
other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.

Michael hurries to catch up.

>south
 Town Square                                         day one

Town Square
A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides
by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this
city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to
the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east
lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley
Bridge.

In the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking
grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of
some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.

Michael hurries to catch up.

Michael makes a weak attempt to whistle.

>east
 Riverwalk                                           day one

Riverwalk
A low, irregular brick wall to the north divides this street from the steep,
mud-slick banks of the sinuous Miskaton, while a rusty iron gate provides access
to a precarious flight of stone steps leading down the bank to the water's edge.
The street bends south here, turning into a misty avenue between the trees. The
town square lies west, a vacant lot lies east.

Michael follows you.

>south
 Chilly Avenue                                       day one

Chilly Avenue
Perhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky
waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems
perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads
lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.

A clammy mist hangs thickly in the air, seeping through your clothes and making
you shiver.

Michael hurries to catch up.

>sw
 Scenic View                                         day one

As you walk through, the mists part before your husband almost deferentially,
quickly dissolving away into nothing.

The ground begins to rise sharply as the road climbs up into the hills south of
town.

Scenic View
The treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest-northeast bend in
the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the
grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the
paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding
ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east.
Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost
directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just
make out the shape of the obelisk from here.

Michael hurries to catch up.

>nw
 Outside the House                                   day one

Outside the House
The lane runs up from the southeast and ends at a wide clearing surrounded by
gnarled and ancient trees. A wide, curving driveway runs up to the front door of
your house, which lies north.

The fabled Verlac family mansion looms before you in the gloom, its dark
creaking presence dominating the clearing and, somehow, even though it is not
visible through the trees, the entire valley. The foreboding shadow of the
Verlacs seems to enshroud all of Anchorhead from here.

A typewritten notice has been attached to the front door.

Michael follows you.

"Well," says Michael, "this must be the place. We finally made it, honey. We're
home!"

 Outside the House                                   day one

You unlock the front door.

>north
(opening the front door first)
You close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.

Foyer
Although it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels
cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high.
The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows,
and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not
a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and
timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.

The front door stands open to the south.

Carelessly stacked in a towering heap in the middle of the room are all your
luggage and belongings, which you had sent ahead through a moving company before
driving up to Massachusetts. Everything you own is boxed away and piled up in
the middle of the floor. The reality of this move finally slams home as you
stare at the sprawling jumble of stuff, and suddenly you feel very lost and
adrift.

Night has now undeniably fallen, and the house is very, very dark. There is

 Foyer                                               day one, evening

probably just enough residual ambience to feel your way upstairs to the bedroom,
but the rest of the house is a tenebrous maze of shadows, and any exploring
would probably best be done in the morning.

Michael follows you.

Michael stretches his arms and yawns. "Well," he says, "I think I'm going to
turn in. There'll be plenty of time to unpack and explore tomorrow. Good night,
hon." He kisses you on the cheek. "Don't stay up too late."

And with that, he goes upstairs.

 Upstairs Landing                                    day one, evening

Upstairs Landing
A narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the
house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.

>north
 Master Bedroom                                      day one, evening

Master Bedroom
The master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded
sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing
mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly
beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster
bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house.

Michael is curled up in bed, sound asleep.

If it weren't for this hopelessly backwater town and the disturbing
circumstances surrounding the house, you'd say this was your dream home. Even
so, as much as you would like to relax and enjoy the comforts of a fully
furnished historical New England estate, you can't help but be put off by the
shady aura surrounding the family that used to live here. The last of the line,
you remind yourself, recently committed suicide after killing his wife and two
daughters with a shotgun. Involuntarily you shiver, glancing nervously at the
doorways to the south and west.

A small chamber of cold, white tile and floral-print wallpaper. It sports a
genuine, whitewashed, claw-foot bathtub with a shower attachment, which is a
definite plus. The bedroom lies east.

>bathe
 Bathroom                                            day one, evening

Grateful for the opportunity to relax, you draw a hot bath (the water, at least,
is running, even if nothing else in the house is) and soak. The tension of this
strange day melts gently from your body. After thirty minutes or so, you begin
to feel normal again. After forty-five, you begin to think you might be able to
adjust to this place after all. By then the water has begun to cool off,
however, so you drain it and quietly dry yourself off. All in all, you feel
enormously better.

Your score has just gone up by one point.

>lie in bed
 Master Bedroom, on the four-poster bed              day one, evening

Gratefully, you crawl into bed and pull the covers up to your chin.

>sleep
Almost immediately you fall asleep, and as the wind slithers around the eaves
and the house creaks furtive secrets to itself, you drift into troubling
dreams...


You are waiting in your bed, with the coverlet up under your chin, waiting for
Father to come tuck you in. Footsteps in the hall pause outside your door. You
close your eyes; when you open them again Father is standing at the foot of the
bed. His eyes are bloodshot, rimmed with red, and you wonder if he has been
crying. Slowly, he starts to take off his belt.

Only it's not your father after all, it's Michael. He hands you a golden sphere
and says:

"I don't know what it opens yet but I have an idea."

Your reflection is like a little doll trapped inside the sphere. Everything is
tinged with gold. Your face swells and stretches comically as you stare back at
yourself through the curved, distorting walls. Reaching out, your fingers curve
back on themselves... the wall breaks and...

You are running from the eyes, the terrible red-rimmed eyes, through endless,
narrow corridors of wooden slats and crumbling plaster. You stumble through turn
after turn, hopelessly lost. There is a small hole in the boards -- peering

through it you see Michael in the study, typing diligently away. You scream, you
pound on the wall, but he can't hear you. The red-rimmed eyes draw closer;
hurrying down a twisting passage you find a dead end... the wall breaks and...

Outside, you stand at another dead end, a high brick wall at the end of a steep,
twisting lane. Written in black spraypaint...

He always returns to his blood.

Behind you, you hear the buzzing of a fly. You turn...
                             * THE SECOND DAY *

                 It is hard to prevent the impression
                 of a faint, malign odour about the village
                 street, as of the massed mould and decay of
                 centuries. It is always a relief to get
                 clear of the place.

water coming from the bathroom.

The shower suddenly stops. Quickly you palm the card, replace the wallet and

the bathroom, toweling his hair. "My, don't you look tempting this morning," he
says, giving you a kiss. He tosses the towel back into the bathroom and gets
dressed. "I think I'm going to stay home and get some writing done. I don't
actually start work until tomorrow, so..." He kisses you on the cheek as he
walks out into the hall. "If you go out today, see if you can find a newspaper.
I want to learn as much as I can about this town."

He looks at you for a moment, and his voice becomes serious. "I love you, hon.
You know that, don't you? I really want us to try and be happy here."

Then he turns and pads down the hall.

You take a deep breath as he goes. You've never lied to Michael or hidden
anything from him before, ever; now, hardly two days into your new life, you're
already sneaking through his wallet.

Oh yeah. You're off to a great start.

Reluctantly, you do so.

Master Bedroom
The master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded
sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing
mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly
beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster
bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house. Doorways lead west and
south.

Your clothes lie in an untidy pile on the floor.

Your trenchcoat is here.

You can also see your umbrella and a keyring (on which are two keys (a key to
the house and a key to the cellar)) here.

Foyer
Although it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels
cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high.
The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows,
and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not
a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and
timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.

Your luggage is still here, spread out all over the foyer.

 Dining Room                                         day two

Dining Room
Much of the elegance has faded from this room. The huge dining table running the
length of it is covered with a thick gray film of dust, and the china cupboard
standing against the far wall is draped in shadow. Doorways to the north and
east offer little relief from the gloom. For what must be the hundredth time,
you wish you could open the windows in this place.

before Michael was contacted, perhaps. Down at the bottom of the cupboard is a
velvet lining, where the silverware would usually be kept.

tucked underneath it. Intrigued, you pull the little book free.

Kitchen
Where once pots and skillets and various utensils hung in profusion, the kitchen
walls are now merely ranks of dusty cabinets and a forest of empty hooks.
Doorways lead east and south, a small pantry lies to the northwest, and the back
door to the north leads out of the house.

Someone's flashlight is lying on the kitchen counter; one of the movers must
have left it.

An odd feeling of gloom overtakes you momentarily, and you find yourself
thinking about the Verlac family's personal effects -- the everyday mundanities,
such as kitchen utensils. Were they thrown out, or donated to charity, or
auctioned off as grisly souvenirs? What about the canned goods? Did anyone think
to take them? The cabinets might even still be stocked. Morbidly, you wonder
what Mrs. Edward Verlac might have been cooking for dinner the night her husband
blew her head off.

The old, flagstone walls gleam with unwholesome-smelling moisture, and the

You spend some time poking dispiritedly through boxes of second-hand table
settings, discarded shoes and outdated encyclopedias, but the only thing you
manage to dig up is an old cardboard box full of newspaper clippings, which
might make interesting reading later if you can find the time. The only thing at
all noteworthy about the room, in fact, is that it desperately wants cleaning;
there's even a big, nasty-looking spider web in a corner behind one of the
crates.

A long, oak-paneled room, with doorways to the south and west. Paintings line
the walls, mounted beneath small, shaded lamps that would illuminate the
canvasses nicely if only the electricity were working. Still, even in the
shadowed gloom you can see that all were done by the same artist.

>look at paintings
 Gallery                                             day two

All of them are bizarre, and most of them border on the grotesque. Alien
landscapes peopled by writhing, malformed creatures; ancient temples built in
strange, eye-bending architectures; monstrous beasts crawling through shadows
that cannot quite conceal their disturbingly human shapes -- these seem to make
up the bulk of the paintings' subject matter. And yet, despite the fantastical
nature of the images painted, the style is neither abstract nor surreal. In
fact, the level of detail approaches the photorealistic. Excruciating attention
has been paid to light, shadows, and textures; even the alien creatures are
depicted with gruesome anatomical accuracy. It is as though the artist had
worked from actual, living models rather than from what must have been a
thoroughly deranged imagination, and the overall effect is rather chilling.

One scene in particular catches your eye.

>look at scene
A young apprentice butcher learns his trade in a slaughterhouse. The older man
-- heavyset, thick jaw and sloping brow -- holds his cleaver above a severed
calf's head, looking expectantly at the boy as though demonstrating the proper
technique. The boy, holding a smaller cleaver of his own, looks on attentively.
It would be reminiscent of something by Norman Rockwell, except for the frankly
alarming amount of gore. The aprons and faces of both master and apprentice are
streaked with blood; blood pools on the chopping block and overspills the
gutters; blood drips from the walls and from the skinned carcasses that can be
seen hanging in the background. The two butchers stand ankle-deep in a reeking
abattoir.

And... there's something wrong with the boy. Most of his body is hidden behind
the chopping block, but there are details about the parts you can see that...
don't seem to fit quite right. The arm holding the cleaver is slightly
misshapen, for example, the fingers deformed in a way that you can't quite make
out. And his neck seems just a bit too thick, and his head seems just a bit too
large and blocky. His face looks normal enough, except that it seems to have
been placed just slightly off-center. It's a very subtly disturbing effect.

You shake yourself suddenly, and realize you've been staring intently at the
painting for minutes on end. You step back and rub your tired eyes. When you

 Gallery                                             day two

look again, however, the picture you were just examining is no longer in front
of you. None of the other paintings have moved as far as you can tell, but that
particular scene seems to have disappeared without leaving so much as a blank
space on the wall.

 Sitting Room                                        day two

Sitting Room
The east wall is occupied by a beautiful antique sofa, and a large, hand-woven
rug covers the hardwood floor. The huge marble fireplace in the north wall helps
complete the impression of comfort and warmth, and for a moment or two you can
almost think of this place as somewhere you could live, as opposed to merely
somewhere others have died. The foyer lies west, and a doorway to the left of
the fireplace leads north.

Your brief sense of comfort quickly drains away, however, as you become aware of
the icy and maniacal stare emanating from the great portrait hanging over the
mantelpiece. Under the malefic gaze of those red-rimmed eyes, the most
comforting thought you can muster is that of immediate flight.

On the sofa is a family album.

unadorned except for name "Verlac" embossed on the front. Glancing at the title
page, you notice two details: one, the book was self-published; and two, it was
published in 1944. So it's a good bet that Edward Verlac and his family aren't
mentioned here.

Whatever else their faults may have been, the Verlacs were evidently not ones to
shun the printed word. Books line the walls from floor to ceiling in this dark-
paneled, green-carpeted room, interrupted only by doorways to the east and
south. A rich, brown leather armchair sits in stately repose near the window,
with a polished brass pipe stand nearby completing the picture of some blue-
blooded country squire's literary refuge. Once again, you are struck by how
easily this place could have been the perfect home.

A beautiful pair of mahogany sliding doors stand closed to the east.

Resting on the pipe stand is a sizable volume decorated with a gilded pentagram

Essentially, it's a textbook on the theory and practice of magickal wards and
seals, mystic symbols inscribed on doors and containers in order to keep people
and spirits out -- or in. It's all very deliberately vague and arcane (in
addition to being written in medieval French and translated into Middle English,
making it nearly impossible to understand), the kind of thing that likely got
many a scholar burned at the stake in those days.

You are surprised to find that a page in this old and probably quite valuable
book has been folded down, as though to mark the place. The section marked
discusses various methods of opening doors that have been sealed with the image
of a pagan god. Speaking aloud the deity's true name will usually do the trick,
apparently.

You pick up the bundle of soggy pages. It appears to have been someone's diary.
There must have been a leak at some time behind the wall where it was hidden,
because most of the pages are water-logged and completely illegible. However,
portions of a few entries remain untouched.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

>read pages
Carefully, you turn the tattered pages. The handwriting is that of a young girl.
You idly wonder if this might have been the diary of one of Edward Verlac's
daughters -- but then you notice part of a date, just visible in the corner of
the page: 1953. This must have been written, then, several years before Edward
was born.

The entries that are legible read as follows:

...Father came again to my bed last night... mother doesn't... tells me I
can't... to be a good daughter. Sometimes it hurts, but Father always tells me I
shouldn't cry. Father says a daughter must do her Duty if she wants to get into
Heaven. And I do want to get into Heaven...

[this entry dated 1957] ...my poor little William. Father calls him an
aberration, child of the Devil, but I don't believe... locked in the attic. I go
to see him whenever Father is away. I sing to him, sometimes, through the
keyhole, and slip him sweets through the crack under the door... my baby is
beautiful... can't let him hurt my dear baby William... to the doctor, and he
has a plan... I can never... this locket, William, and I will always keep
yours... to always remember my face...

 Children's Bedroom                                  day two

Nothing else is readable except for one fragmented entry near the very end of
the book, the date in the corner reading February 27, 1961:

...dead, but not dead yet... will not allow him to do to Edward what he wanted
to do to William... have learned... given him the charm against the... never
take it off, dear Edward... [a page has been torn away] ...fear to sleep... mist
at the window --

And that's all.

Foyer
Although it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels
cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high.
The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows,
and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not
a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and
timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.

Your luggage is still here, spread out all over the foyer.

Path Behind the House
A gravel path starts here at the back door of the house, and marks a trail
nearly overgrown by weeds and briars. It disappears into the undergrowth to the

stunted, jagged archway into the dim recesses of the forest.

Stooping to avoid the sharp, bare twigs that snag your clothes and seem to reach
greedily for your eyes, you pick your way through the undergrowth to a small
clearing.

Family Plot
Old, moss-slimed tombstones, many broken off and leaning crazily like an old
man's teeth, poke up from the soft, mulchy earth. In their midst stands an
ancient marble crypt, its heavy iron door nearly obscured by thick draperies of
ivy. The trees press close around this quiet enclave of death, leaning together
over your head as if sharing secrets. A gap in the undergrowth to the southeast
reveals a narrow gravel path.

The faint echo of dripping water and a musty smell of decay grow stronger as you
descend.

In the Crypt
The air is clammy and frigid, the stone walls damp and streaked with mud and
lichen. Pale, swollen roots push through cracks in the masonry. The smell of
damp corruption is almost overpowering here, though the stairs to the south lead
toward fresher air.

The walls of this chamber contain dozens of wide, shallow niches; in each niche,
a coffin.

>examine coffin

Rank upon rank of the ancient Verlac family remains are stacked away in this
hole, left to crumble and deliquesce together, merging back into the dark matter
which gave them birth. Above each niche is a nameplate indicating who was buried
here and when they died.

The nameplate reads "William Verlac, b. June 22, 1954, d. September 18, 1958".
Unlike the others, William's coffin is a ramshackle affair of cheap pine, held
together with rusting nails. It's half-rotten with age and so shabbily built you
could probably open it with your bare hands.

>open coffin

Compelled by a gruesome curiosity, you dig your fingers under the soft, rotting
boards and pry up the lid. With the shriek of pulling nails and a shower of
crumbling wood, the coffin comes open, and you look inside, expecting to find a
child's tiny skeleton...

Dear God.

There's no child buried here. Instead, the coffin contains only the worm-eaten
bones of some kind of animal.

Who would have buried an animal in place of the child that should have been
interred here? And why would they do such a thing? Glumly, you look around at
the rest of the coffins, and realize that anyone who might have known the
answers to these questions is probably already buried in this room.

Scenic View
The treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest-northeast bend in
the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the
grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the
paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding
ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east.
Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost
directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just
make out the shape of the obelisk from here.

Chilly Avenue
Perhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky
waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems
perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads

A low, irregular brick wall to the north divides this street from the steep,
mud-slick banks of the sinuous Miskaton, while a rusty iron gate provides access
to a precarious flight of stone steps leading down the bank to the water's edge.
The street bends south here, turning into a misty avenue between the trees. The
town square lies west, a vacant lot lies east.

A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides
by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this
city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to
the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east
lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley
Bridge.

A damp newspaper lies on the curb, fluttering slightly in the wind.

In the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking
grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of
some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.

 Town Square                                         day two

The front page story is about Jeffrey Greer, 8 years old, who was abducted from
his home at #11 Mill Town Road last night. Little Jeffrey is the latest victim
in a series of abductions that stretches back for years, one every six months or
so, and that authorities believe is the work of a single perpetrator. Local
police had hoped to prove that Edward Verlac had been behind the kidnappings,
but were unable to obtain a confession or any hard proof. Edward Verlac was
convicted of murdering his wife and two daughters, one of whom was 15 months
old, in January of this year; he was found not guilty by reason of insanity and
incarcerated in Danvers Asylum, where he remained until committing suicide last
March. This latest kidnapping, occurring after Edward's death, seems to have
cleared up any lingering suspicions that he might have been the culprit.

Anyone possessing information regarding the whereabouts of Jeffrey Greer is
strongly urged to speak to the authorities as soon as possible.

A long, dimly lit, north-south corridor stretches away from the courthouse
entrance. Closed, unmarked doors line either side of the hall, their pebbled
glass windows lit from within by a murky, yellow-orange light. Silence reigns
here; your footsteps echo eerily on the tiled floor, and occasionally you can
hear muted conversation behind one of the doors -- you can't tell which. At the

Whateley Bridge
A hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is
possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans
the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south
halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its
underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each
other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.

 University Court                                    day two

University Court
Isolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University
represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural
achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and
enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further
into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for
its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most
extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer
Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage
and his plans to move into the estate. Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they
take care of their own.

There are numerous buildings surrounding this cobbled court, but the only one
you are interested in is the library to the west.

A flurry of dead leaves goes skittering along the ground, swirling past you in

cast pools of warm radiance here and there around the library's dim interior.

A high counter divides the public portion of the library from the reserved

collection. If anything, the area behind the counter is even more shadowy than
the side you're on. The main reading area lies south.

Hanging on the wall next to the counter is a small, printed sign. Beneath the
sign sits a heavy, dog-eared register, and sitting next to the register is a

Circulation Desk
A high counter divides the public portion of the library from the reserved
stacks -- all the more esoteric and mysterious volumes from the university's
collection. If anything, the area behind the counter is even more shadowy than
the side you're on. The main reading area lies south.

Hanging on the wall next to the counter is a small, printed sign. Beneath the
sign sits a heavy, dog-eared register, and sitting next to the register is a
bell.

Library
Shadows roost thickly in the vaulted ceiling, and small, green-shaded desk lamps
cast pools of warm radiance here and there around the library's dim interior.
You pause a moment to let the hushed peacefulness of this place soak in -- a
welcome relief from the unsettling events of the day. An exit lies east, and a
small alcove to the north houses the circulation counter.

 University Court                                    day two

University Court
Isolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University
represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural
achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and
enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further
into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for
its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most
extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer
Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage
and his plans to move into the estate. Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they
take care of their own.

There are numerous buildings surrounding this cobbled court, but the only one
you are interested in is the library to the west.

Junction
To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a
country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the
east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make
out the vaulted rooftops of the university.

 Narrow Street                                       day two

Narrow Street
As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged
rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the
south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and
a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the
north leads down to the local watering hole.

 Local Pub                                           day two

Local Pub
A dank, drafty old drinking hole lit by flickering, oil-burning lanterns. Smoke
collects in greasy pools among the rafters, and shadows crowd thick around. The
bar runs the length of the room to your right, while to the south a low doorway
opens onto the street.

Mill workers and fishermen occupy a few of the tables, drinking beer or puffing
grimly at long-stemmed pipes. Each is wrapped in his solitude, soaking up the
general miasma of dreary fatalism.

The lantern sitting on the table nearest you sputters fitfully, throwing
distorted shadows across the wall.

You pick up the flask. The label is faded and mostly peeled away, but what
little you can make out seems to indicate that this is not a particularly
distinguished brand of spirits. The words "bootleg" and "rotgut" come to mind,
probably because they are the only words legible on what's left of the label.

Twisting Lane
The lane narrows here to little more than a badly cobbled sidewalk as it wends
its way up through a series of tortuous bends and switchbacks. In some places,
the street is so steep that steps have been cut into it, worn down over the
years and slick with moss. Your progress is blocked at the top of the street by
a blank brick wall.

Someone has sprayed graffiti across the wall in black spraypaint.

It's a strange design done in black spraypaint; an upturned hand with an
irregular triangle inscribed in the palm. Beneath it is drawn an arrow pointing
roughly west, and following it with your gaze, you realize that it points
directly at the narrow aperture of a sidestreet you'd never noticed before.

You had no idea this little courtyard even existed, cleverly tucked away amidst
the confusing tangle of darker avenues. Although surrounded on all sides by
steep rooftops and overshadowed by the ever-ominous clouds, this secluded circle
somehow manages to convey a sense of peace and brightness, a safe harbor from
the oppressive gloom pervading the rest of the town. To the south, a hanging

A silvery bell jingles as you open the door.

The Cauldron
A warm and pleasantly dim light surrounds you and suffuses this cozy little
shop. The shelves are crammed with every conceivable variety of new age
curiosity: books, crystals, pendants, charms, herbs, potions, incense, candles
and -- sure enough, on a display stand right near the door -- decorative cast-
iron cauldron-shaped paperweights. How cute. In the rear of the store, a lit
display case contains several items of interest. The courtyard lies outside, to
the north.

On the display case is a violin.

The proprietor watches you quietly from behind the display case.

"Now there's a fancy little thing," remarks the proprietor. "A humble charm
against evil. A ward against the Eye, you might say. Young chap brought that in
some twenty years ago, said he had no more use for superstitious baubles."

The proprietor reaches in through the back of the case and takes out the amulet.
It spins slowly as he holds it up to the light.

"I think, perhaps, that he eventually found different. And I think, perhaps,
that you will, too." He leans forward and, before you can react, slips the
leather thong around your neck. "But you won't make the same mistake, will you,
Miss? No. You go on and keep that, now. My treat. You may find it useful soon."

The proprietor takes the puzzle box and turns it over in his hands carefully.
"Now, this is a tricky one," he says. "They don't make them like this anymore.
Frightfully difficult, unless you know the catch of course." His fingers flicker
dexterously over the box, sliding a panel here, pressing a corner in there.
Suddenly the lid pops open with a faint snick.

He places the box on top of the display case. "And there you have it," he says.
"A present for you."

 Whateley Bridge                                     day two

Whateley Bridge
A hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is
possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans
the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south
halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its
underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each
other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.

 Town Square                                         day two

Town Square
A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides
by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this
city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to
the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east
lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley
Bridge.

In the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking
grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of
some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.

A low, irregular brick wall to the north divides this street from the steep,
mud-slick banks of the sinuous Miskaton, while a rusty iron gate provides access
to a precarious flight of stone steps leading down the bank to the water's edge.
The street bends south here, turning into a misty avenue between the trees. The
town square lies west, a vacant lot lies east.

Where once a building stood, there is now only cracked pavement and rampant
weeds. A high chain-link fence surrounds this vacant lot; the only breaks lie to

An old man dressed in dirty rags sits on his mattress, muttering to himself as
he stares intently out to sea.

unscrews the cap and tips it up into his waiting mouth. Trickles of pungent
brown liquid ooze from the corners of his mouth as he swallows convulsively, his

back onto his mattress with a beatific smile on his mud-smeared face, the flask
dropping from his fingers.

before Edward, you know. Little Edward and his..." His voice trails off to a
whisper, but you could swear he mouthed the word "brother".

>ask bum about brother
The old man falls silent all of a sudden, and for a while he simply stares down
at his hands, limp and open in his lap. Then, drawing a deep breath, he begins
to speak, and for the first time his voice is steady, without the reedy whine of
alcoholic craving.

"Ayuh, little Edward had a brother, so he did. And I know him. I know of
William, so I do. I delivered the child. Anna Verlac was his mother. It... it
was... "

He leans over and grips your arm with a hand that is suddenly steady and strong.
"It was her father's poison seed, y'see. That evil bastard poisoned her womb and
put a monster inside her. What she gave birth to... it was... it wasn't... oh,
God, when I held that... that abortion in the shape of an infant, that thing
with hooves for feet and its crown of writhing... when it looked up at me... It
looked up at me with its father's red-rimmed eyes." The old man shudders
convulsively, and it is a while before he can speak again.

"Anna and I decided between ourselves, we did. The... her child... it lived for
a few years, but it was sickly, and in pain, and it could never be normal nor
healthy. She brought it to me... I was her doctor, you see, I'd seen her through
her child's birth, and she trusted me... and I put the thing down, softly and

without pain, and they laid it to rest in the family crypt.

"And Anna thanked me for it, so she did."

The old man falls silent again, and his wavering, bloodshot eyes wander once
more out to sea. And he is lost, once again, to the horror and pain of the
memories that can only be silenced by drink.

The old man grows sickly pale. He raises one hand, as if to ward off the sight
of the skull, deny the truth one more time; then his hand drops, and he sinks
down onto the mattress, groaning.

"Oh, it's true," he cries, "it's true, God help my lying soul. It was her father
who wished to kill the thing, not Anna -- kill it to make way for another, he
said, a 'more fitting vessel'. He wanted to try again -- Gods, the depth of his
evil -- after the way the first one came out, he wanted to try again!

"Anna came to me and asked for my help, and what could I do? What could I do? It
was her child, for God's sake, no matter what else it was, and she couldn't bear
to lose it. But we had to weigh the coffin down with something..."

He sits up, suddenly, fastening on you with a sick, pleading look.

"I've told you too much, now," he whispers desperately. "They'll know; the
maggots'll find out for sure. They'll find me; even in my hole, they'll find
me." He lets out an eye-wateringly pungent breath, "P'raps it's best they do.
I've spent so long drowning my sins, p'raps time's come to pay for them at last.
This won't do me much good no more," he says, holding up his little copper key.

"And yet..." He closes his fist around it again. "And yet, maybe there's a
way... they say there's ways to protect yourself, wards versus the Evil Eye and
such. " The old man stares greedily at the amulet around your neck. "Perhaps, if
I could get me one o' those..."

"Thank you kindly, Miss, you're a generous one, so you are," grins the old man
as he closes his grimy fingers around the charm. "And here y'are," he says,
tossing you the copper key. "I'll pray it does you good."

The old man staggers to his feet. "I'll be gettin' on, then," he says. "If I can
make away before nightfall, p'raps I'll be out of their reach before the maggots
come out." He wraps the leather thong around his hand and closes the charm in
his fist.

He turns to you one last time. "Don't let them find you," he says earnestly.
"Get out while you can. If you stay, they'll track you down eventually. It's the
blood. He can smell it, so he can. And he always returns to his blood."

He shambles off, up the riverwalk toward Town Square, his shadow dragging long
behind him. Looking to the sky, you realize that the sun is nearly set; you've
been talking to the old man for much longer than you thought, and it will be
dark soon.

The gentle creaking of hawsers and the hollow slap of water beneath the wooden
pier provide a faint counterpoint to the endless, rhythmic surging of the sea.
The fishing industry (like the paper industry) has all but died away in
Anchorhead; nonetheless there are still a few boats tied to the pier. A path
leads back through an opening in a chain-link fence to the northwest; otherwise,
it's just you and the ocean.

Perhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky

The treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest-northeast bend in
the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the
grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the
paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding
ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east.
Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost
directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just

Although it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels

The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows,

a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and
timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.

The front door stands open to the south.

Your luggage is still here, spread out all over the foyer.

You call out to let Michael know you're home, but no one answers. The house is

Whatever else their faults may have been, the Verlacs were evidently not ones to
shun the printed word. Books line the walls from floor to ceiling in this dark-

Study
This smaller room adjoining the library seems comfortable enough, although it is
dusty and cluttered from having not been lived in for the better part of a year.
Aside from the desk and the chair and the empty shelves, the only real feature
of the room is the large, ornate fireplace in the southern wall.

without your ring on, although sometimes you do find yourself taking it off
briefly, just to read the inscription along the inside.

apparently the last thing Michael was working on before he got up and left.

Michael has evidently been writing something, but it's not a story; it looks
more like some kind of journal entry.

I cannot sleep.

Or perhaps I should say: I must not sleep, since I am perfectly capable of sleep
-- in fact, lately sleep has come to me more easily, more quickly, and more
insidiously than it ever has before. But I don't want to sleep.

I have been hoping that the terrible dreams would prove to be stress-related,
that they would fade once the move was behind us and we had finally settled in
-- but that has not turned out to be the case. They're stronger than ever. Red-
rimmed eyes pursuing me through strange corridors, and the voice -- the
whisperer who tells me I am not who I am. The whisperer tells me secrets of this
house, secrets of those who lived here -- they are my blood, and he tells me he
always returns to his blood. He tells me of secret keys and combinations; I
don't know what they open yet but I have an idea --

Tomorrow I must go down to the cellar. I must see if the things revealed to me
in that terrible book are true.

Whatever else their faults may have been, the Verlacs were evidently not ones to
shun the printed word. Books line the walls from floor to ceiling in this dark-

It's much cooler up here than in the rest of the house, and you find it hard to

Attic Cell
A cramped little annex off the main attic, with a tiny, shuttered window high up

Gratefully, you crawl into bed and pull the covers up to your chin.

>sleep
You lie awake for what seems like hours, listening to the house creak and settle
around you and wondering where your husband is. You try to convince yourself
that he merely went for a walk and lost track of the time, as he is so often
wont to do. In any case, with no telephone and no car, there is little you can
do besides hope that he will turn up in the morning. With your worried thoughts
chasing themselves endlessly around your mind, you eventually drift off into an
uneasy sleep...


Down the road and through the woods, where the whippoorwills call their
lunatic's song, you are running. The sky boils and thunders overhead. The red-
rimmed eyes glare down at you. When you look up at them, they merge together,
melting into a single, baleful orb -- a swollen, bloody moon.

You must escape. You veer off the road, tripping over an old, rotted stump,
pushing aside a twisted sapling. Vines and brambles tear at your clothes. Rocks
cut your feet. But still you must run, until you suddenly burst out of the
underbrush, into a tangled, moonlit clearing.

An ancient, flagstone well stands amidst the weeds in the clearing's center, and
you are drawn to it. Something is moving inside, scratching at the stones down
in that circle of blackness, and for some reason all you can think is the
basement, Michael is in the basement, and he's doing something bad...

Heart hammering, you lean over the crumbling lip. Your hair slips from your
shoulders, dangling tantalizingly close to the well's opening...

... the whippoorwills reach a crescendo...

Your eyes adjust to the dark and you see --

   -- you see the most horrible thing --
                              * THE THIRD DAY *

                 It was his twin brother, but it looked more

You try to get dressed as quietly as possible, but apparently Michael isn't as
knocked out as you thought he was. Michael comes awake with a jerk and a hoarse
shout. For a moment or two he only stares about blindly, as if unsure of where
he is and all but unaware of your presence. Then, with a grunt of surprise, he
seems to come to his senses and painstakingly crawls out of bed.

The fireplace is carved from beautiful, dark-veined marble, a strange shade that
is not quite a deep, forest green and not quite a murky, dusky red. The
mantelpiece is flanked by a pair of polished brass spheres.

and the sphere snaps back into its original position. Suddenly, the entire
fireplace slides about eighteen inches to the left with a hollow grinding sound,
revealing a narrow corridor in the southwest wall.

Standing on tiptoe and placing your eye up to the hole, you see the children's
bedroom. Through some strange trick of the angle, you appear to be looking
straight down at the bed from the middle of the ceiling.

Suddenly Michael walks into the bedroom. He moves slowly, looking around and
lightly touching things, as if visiting old memories. He walks over to the crib
and spends some minutes staring down into its empty blankets, after which he
sighs. Then he turns and adjusts the coverlet on the child's bed.

He walks over to the vanity and picks up the jewelry box. Carefully, he opens it
and, finding it empty, sets it down again with a soft curse. He looks around the
room suspiciously, as if expecting to find the culprit hiding in a corner
somewhere. For a moment Michael simply stands there aimlessly, compulsively
rubbing his forehead; then he stalks out of the room and is gone.

Standing on tiptoe and placing your eye up to the hole, you see the sitting
room, from a vantage high up on the wall. It occurs to you that you might well
be looking directly through the eyes of the man in the portrait hanging over the
fireplace.

At that moment, Michael wanders into the sitting room, muttering something
incoherent. He looks around blankly, lost, as if he had come into the room in
order to do something only in the next instant to forget what it was. Then his
eyes fall on you, and he smiles.

You nearly jerk away from the spyhole, heart pounding wildly, when it suddenly
occurs to you that he's not looking at you at all; he's looking at the portrait
through which you are peering.

Michael regards the portrait with a strange air of familiarity. He gazes into
its eyes (and also, unbeknownst to him, your own eyes) the way one might
appraise an old friend one hasn't seen for some time. His expression is
deferential, admiring, and... something else; you can't quite put your finger on
at first, but as your husband continues to gaze rhapsodically at the terrible
portrait, a sickening realization strikes you.

The expression is vanity. Ugly, self-absorbed vanity. Your husband is staring at
this portrait the way he might preen himself in a mirror.

Michael brushes his fingers back through his hair and walks out of the room,
chuckling softly to himself.

There is a small hole in one of the slats, about halfway up the wall.

>look in hole
(the small hole)
Standing on tiptoe and placing your eye up to the hole, you see only darkness.

Just as you are about to move away from the spyhole, you hear footsteps on a
stone floor. A light shines in through a doorway, and a moment later Michael
skulks into the room, which you now realize is the wine cellar, seen from down
low in a corner, near the floor.

Halfway across the room he stops, darts a suspicious glance over his shoulder,
and shines his light into every corner, as though searching for potential spies.
At one point he looks straight at you, and you nearly recoil, alarmed at the
sight of his crazed, red-rimmed eyes. He does not spot you, however, and in a
moment he moves on.

He walks over to the rack at the north end of the room, and does something with
the bottles -- you can't quite see, because his back is toward you. Then there
is a click and a heavy grinding sound, and the entire northern wall swings back,
revealing a hidden passage!

The room is filled for a moment with a wild, wretched keening, like a cold wind
blowing through an empty chasm. With one last, wary look behind him, Michael

steps through the portal. The light disappears, the wall swings back with
another grinding sound, and then all is quiet.

You are in a small, enclosed cupola situated, by the look of the view through
the dingy skylight over your head, on top of the roof of the house. The walls
are covered with astrological and astronomical charts with equations and
diagrams scribbled across them in crabbed, stilted handwriting. The only exit
seems to be an oddly-angled corridor to the southeast.

Dominating the center of the room is a large mounted telescope, pointed almost
straight up through the skylight.

Dear Christ, you can see it.

 Crawlspace                                          day three

As you make your way down the corridor, you begin to get dizzy, then nauseous.
Lines seem to cross without bending, the ceiling becomes the walls and the floor
becomes the ceiling. Half-blind, unsure even of which direction you were going
in, you stagger forward and suddenly find yourself in a...

Crawlspace
The ceiling descends here to no more than three feet from the floor; you are
forced to crawl through the cramped darkness on your hands and knees. To the
east the attic becomes more spacious, while the northwest corner opens into an
oddly-angled corridor.

 Attic                                               day three

Attic
It's much cooler up here than in the rest of the house, and you find it hard to
suppress a shiver. Grotesque, looming shadows crawl across the low, slanted
ceiling, and the dust hangs thick and motionless in the air. To the west the
ceiling dips even lower until the space beneath leaves hardly room enough to
crawl, while to the north stands a wooden door, draped in shadows and half-
hidden by the slanting eaves.

 Upstairs Hall                                       day three

The ancient rungs creak alarmingly as you descend.

Upstairs Hall
The shuttered window at the end of the hall throws a gloomy rectangle of light
onto the bare wooden floor. Doorways lead north and south.

A rickety wooden ladder stands here, descending from a three-foot by three-foot
square of darkness in the ceiling.

 Upstairs Landing                                    day three

A narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the
house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.

 Foyer                                               day three

Foyer
Although it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels
cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high.
The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows,
and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not
a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and
timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.

Your luggage is still here, spread out all over the foyer.

 Kitchen                                             day three

Kitchen
Where once pots and skillets and various utensils hung in profusion, the kitchen
walls are now merely ranks of dusty cabinets and a forest of empty hooks.
Doorways lead east and south, a small pantry lies to the northwest, and the back
door to the north leads out of the house.

>nw
 Pantry                                              day three

The pantry is empty save for a layer of dust on the shelves. A door to the south
leads down to the cellar, or you can return to the kitchen to the southeast.

The cellar door stands open, revealing dark stairs leading down.

 Cellar                                              day three

You descend the gloomy steps into the dank cellar.

Cellar
The old, flagstone walls gleam with unwholesome-smelling moisture, and the
sagging timbers creak uneasily above your head. Ancient, frayed wiring festoons
the ceiling like some strange species of clinging vine. Portions of the cellar
extend south and east into the clammy darkness, though you could always beat a
hasty retreat up the stairs to the north.

One largish bundle of wires leads down to a rusty old fuse cabinet bolted to the
far wall.

>east
 Wine Cellar                                         day three

Wine Cellar
This wing of the cellar is even older than the rest, with walls of piled,
unmortared stone. The entire room is filled with wine racks. They cover every
wall except for one spot to the west, where an exit leads back to the main
cellar.

All of the racks are dust-covered and empty except for one against the north
wall, which contains some forty or fifty dark bottles.

You are reminded of something Michael told you during the long drive up: about
how when the police arrived after the shooting, they found the wine cellar in a
shambles -- nearly every bottle thrown to the floor and shattered, and the whole
place reeking of rotted grapes. All except the bottles in the north rack. None
of those had been touched. No one could posit a motive for it.

You smile a bit, recalling your husband's ability to turn a piece of
insignificant trivia into a compelling story. Still, though, now that you're
actually standing here... it all seems very strange.

 Wine Cellar                                         day three

There are five bottles in the third row from the bottom that have been handled
recently; the fingermarks are clearly outlined on their dusty labels. One label
is partially torn and the other is all but faded completely, but at a quick

The bottle of light Cheval Blanc rotates a quarter-turn clockwise, then snaps
back with a loud "click". A rumbling grating sound suddenly fills the wine
cellar, and the racks and a portion of the stone wall behind them swing back,
revealing a dark passageway to the north from which blows a hot, foul wind.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

 Windy Passage                                       day three

You take a few cautious steps into the corridor, when the wall suddenly slams
shut behind you with a reverberating boom. You are trapped!

Windy Passage
The walls of this passageway are carved from solid rock with unearthly
precision; ten feet wide, ten feet high, perfectly smooth and perfectly square.
The passage runs north, sloping downward into the depths of the hillside. A foul
wind gusts intermittently from the darkness below.

>north
 Edge of the Pit                                     day three

Edge of the Pit
The passageway ends here at a fathomless pit, a puckered circular hole in the
rock from which the foul wind seems to emanate, howling up from the depths like
a reeking banshee.

A thin and decrepit rope bridge spans the pit, shivering occasionally in the
wind.

Another blast of hot, foul-smelling air comes shrieking out of the pit.

>north
 Other Side                                          day three

Carefully, you edge out onto the swaying planks. The planks creak and bend
beneath your weight. One of them snaps just as you lift your weight from it,
coming very close to spilling you into the abyss below. A few more steps,
however, and you are safely on the other side.

Other Side
The passageway turns east here, the stone floor dropping down in a series of
wide steps carved into the living rock. The stairs continue down to the
northeast, eventually curving out of sight. The only other way on from here is a
narrow, oddly-angled corridor in the northwest corner.

 Bottom of Stairs                                    day three

The metallic door suddenly rings out as if struck; it vibrates in aching harmony
with the blasphemous name -- a shrill, grating sound like a dentist's drill. The
air grows thick and terrible shapes waver and melt in the air before you --
shapes that twitch and move with hungry purpose, and seem to look at you -- and
then the ringing fades away. There is a moment of stillness, and then the
gleaming door swings smoothly open on perfectly balanced and utterly silent
hinges.

>north
 Burial Mound                                        day three

The doorway opens out into a large, dome-ceilinged cavern. You stand at the
threshold for a moment, peering into the strange, phosphorescent gloom, before
your eyes can make out enough details to see what this place is; even then, it
is almost a full minute before your mind can accept what you are seeing...

Burial Mound
The cave is lined, floor to ceiling, with mummified human corpses. Shrunken and
desiccated, they lie in jumbled heaps inside irregularly carved niches. Carvings
cover the rock walls in between the niches -- grotesque, leering faces too
horrible even to look upon, their features twitching and smirking in the
wavering light that sifts down from above.

And dominating the center of the chamber: a dark monolith rising up through the
green, murky light -- what you first took to be a large, supporting pillar, you
now realize can only be the true base of the town square obelisk.

At the narrower, northern end of the vaguely egg-shaped cavern sits a massive
stone altar, flanked on either side by a pair of strange, vibrating columns.

Outside the House
The lane runs up from the southeast and ends at a wide clearing surrounded by
gnarled and ancient trees. A wide, curving driveway runs up to the front door of
your house, which lies north.

The front door stands open to the north.

The Verlac mansion looms before you, casting an air of menace over the clearing.

A typewritten notice has been attached to the front door.

The hairs on the back of your neck prickle as you step outside. Something is
wrong. Something is very wrong with the air. A heavy, charged sensation, like
standing next to high-tension wires; a faint odor of spoiled meat drifting on
the wind; you can't put your finger on it, but it might have something to do
with that strange hole in the sky.

 Scenic View                                         day three

Scenic View
The treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest-northeast bend in
the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the
grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the
paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding
ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east.
Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost
directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just
make out the shape of the obelisk from here.

 Chilly Avenue                                       day three

Chilly Avenue
Perhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky
waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems
perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads
lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.

In the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting
on the wind.

>south
 Deserted Lane                                       day three

Deserted Lane
The gently winding lane makes its way through the birch woods south of town. New
England foliage is famous for its splendid colors in the fall, but the
oppressive weather and pervading murk have leached these trees of most of their
tint. The road continues south into the increasingly dense forest, and in the
other direction heads back to town. A paved walk also leads east through the
trees.

>south
 Down the Road                                       day three

Down the Road
The forest grows denser as you go, crowding thickly up to either side of the
road. The groping, tangled branches block out what little sunlight there is
left. Your footsteps are muffled; whispering leaves and the slow drip of water
are the only sounds you can hear. Beyond the watching trees, the shadows are
impenetrably thick. The road stretches interminably, north to south.

There's something strangely familiar about the woods here... scenes from last
night's dream flicker through your memory, but you are unable to recall the
details.

>look at woods
 Down the Road                                       day three

You scrutinize the edge of the road carefully, looking for whatever it was you
saw...

There. On the west side. That stump, and the twisted sapling growing next to it;
you recognize them. And just beyond them... the path. It's the path you took in
your dream, a narrow rut running west through the underbrush. You can hardly
believe it, but there it is.

 Trampled Path                                       day three

Trampled Path
The tangled undergrowth has been beaten down in a path leading roughly from the
east to the southwest. Shrubs and grass have been flattened and pushed aside,
vines torn down, and small trees bent or even snapped in half, as though
something heavy with huge, flat feet had simply trampled its way through.

 Abandoned Slaughterhouse                            day three

Abandoned Slaughterhouse
The decayed remains of an old slaughterhouse stand here, now little more than a
shell of crumbling brick and gaping holes, surrounded by a clearing of yellow,
sickly grass. A path leads northeast, back toward the road; to the west, a
gaping hole that might once have been a doorway leads into the rotting building.

The forest is unnaturally quiet here, you notice; there are no birds calling, no
leaves rustling or branches creaking; even the whippoorwills have fallen silent.
All is still, holding its collective breath in an expectant hush.

>west
 Crumbled Ruin                                       day three

Crumbled Ruin
The roof has collapsed, leaving the interior open to the sky; the floor is
nothing but bare, beaten dirt. Gaps in the bricks lead east and south. Although
nothing stands now but the tottering, crumbling stonework (and that only
barely), you fancy you can still detect a faint miasma of death -- a palpable,
chilling reminder of the bloody work which once went on within these walls.

There's something odd about the ground here; some faint marking or pattern.

An old rusty meat hook sticks out of the ground nearby, its point half-buried in
the dirt.

Over in the far corner, a tattered sheet of drawing paper lies discarded on the
ground.

You pick up the tattered drawing. The drawing is of a pair of crudely rendered
figures, scrawled with dark, heavy lines that occasionally punch right through
the paper. The two figures are holding hands. The one on the left is a smiling
woman with long, straight hair; the one on the right...

Well, you don't know. Frankly, you'd rather not speculate. An octopus on human
legs, maybe, if you could believe any healthy child would conceive of such a
thing. Above the first figure is scribbled the word "MOMY"; above the second,
"WILAM (ME)".

You pick up the meat hook. The crossbar fits in your palm, leaving the hook part
to stick out between the third and fourth fingers. It's a heavy sucker, nearly
fifteen inches long from handle to point, made for hauling around carcasses with
a minimum of ceremony. You wouldn't like to think what this could do to a living
person.

Old Stone Well
Beyond the south wall of the old slaughterhouse, there is nothing but a tangled
thicket so dense as to be impenetrable in every direction except to the north,
where you can slip back into the ruined slaughterhouse through a hole in the

Rising from the midst of the underbrush is a squat circle of stone: the top of
an ancient well. A circle of rotting plywood covers the opening.

The sky is a dim circle of light far above you. The stone walls press in on you

 In the Well, lying under the children's bones       day three

You burrow down into the bones, piling more bones on top of you for cover while
trying to make as little noise as possible.

You hear it pause inside the building, its hide slithering loudly against the
brick walls as it moves about. There is a horrible, wet snorting sound, as if it
were trying to pick up a scent, then an unspeakable, inhuman grunt of anger.

>wait
Time passes.

Scarcely daring to breathe, you lie as still as possible beneath your cover of
bones as the thing, whatever it is, moves closer. A shadow falls across the
mouth of the well, and then the circle of light above you is blotted out by a
shape so utterly, blasphemously hideous that it is all you can do to remain
conscious. Two grotesquely blue and childlike eyes blink down into the darkness
of the well, searching...


 In the Well, lying under the children's bones       day three

And then it is gone.

You must have lost consciousness after all, judging from the stiffness in your
limbs and the difference in the light. You have no idea how long you were out,
but the creature must have passed you by. The forest is still again; the
breathing and footsteps, gone.

Involuntarily, you let out a long, shuddering breath.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

>up

 Old Stone Well                                      day three

You painstakingly climb out of the old well.

Old Stone Well
Beyond the south wall of the old slaughterhouse, there is nothing but a tangled
thicket so dense as to be impenetrable in every direction except to the north,
where you can slip back into the ruined slaughterhouse through a hole in the
wall.

Rising from the midst of the underbrush is a squat circle of stone: the top of
an ancient well.

A rotting circle of plywood leans against the side of the well.

>north
 Crumbled Ruin                                       day three

Crumbled Ruin
The roof has collapsed, leaving the interior open to the sky; the floor is
nothing but bare, beaten dirt. Gaps in the bricks lead east and south. Although
nothing stands now but the tottering, crumbling stonework (and that only
barely), you fancy you can still detect a faint miasma of death -- a palpable,
chilling reminder of the bloody work which once went on within these walls.

There's something odd about the ground here; some faint marking or pattern.

>east
 Abandoned Slaughterhouse                            day three

Abandoned Slaughterhouse
The decayed remains of an old slaughterhouse stand here, now little more than a
shell of crumbling brick and gaping holes, surrounded by a clearing of yellow,
sickly grass. A path leads northeast, back toward the road; to the west, a
gaping hole that might once have been a doorway leads into the rotting building.

>ne
 Trampled Path                                       day three

Trampled Path
The tangled undergrowth has been beaten down in a path leading roughly from the
east to the southwest. Shrubs and grass have been flattened and pushed aside,
vines torn down, and small trees bent or even snapped in half, as though
something heavy with huge, flat feet had simply trampled its way through.

>east
 Down the Road                                       day three

Down the Road
The forest grows denser as you go, crowding thickly up to either side of the
road. The groping, tangled branches block out what little sunlight there is
left. Your footsteps are muffled; whispering leaves and the slow drip of water
are the only sounds you can hear. Beyond the watching trees, the shadows are
impenetrably thick. The road stretches interminably, north to south.

At the edge of the forest, on the west side of the road, stand the rotted stump
and twisted sapling from your dream.

>north
Deserted Lane
The gently winding lane makes its way through the birch woods south of town. New
England foliage is famous for its splendid colors in the fall, but the
oppressive weather and pervading murk have leached these trees of most of their
tint. The road continues south into the increasingly dense forest, and in the
other direction heads back to town. A paved walk also leads east through the
trees.

A small group of townsfolk has gathered up at the north end of the road. As you
approach, still breathless from your encounter with the thing at the
slaughterhouse, they turn toward you -- and that's when you notice that the one
in the lead has an axe in his hand. And the one behind him has a pair of garden
shears.

A couple of men move over to your left, and several more step out of the forest
behind you. All of them carry weapons or nasty farm implements of some kind, and
all of them look as though they're just about ready to put an end to a certain
over-curious, outsider woman who doesn't know enough to keep her nose out of
things better left undisturbed.

 Churchyard                                          day three

You dart past the men on your right, making a break for the church. The
townsfolk hover around the entrance to the churchyard but do not follow you,
confident that there is no way you can escape.

Churchyard
A low, wrought-iron fence, its spike-tipped bars bent or leaning at crazy
angles, surrounds the overgrown yard of this dark, abandoned church. A gap in
the fence leads back west, while a bare path beaten through the groping weeds
leads around the church to the southeast.

A gust of wind blows your hair into your face.

>se
 Behind the Church                                   day three

The path bends northeast, around the side of the church.

Behind the Church
The forest encroaches right up to the iron fence here, some of which is
literally buried in the tangled underbrush. There are no doors on this side,
although a wooden trap door over by the corner of the building probably leads
into a cellar. A path leads southwest, around to the front of the church.

>break padlock with hook
 Behind the Church                                   day three

You raise the meat hook high over your head and bring it squarely down onto the
padlock. The rusted metal casing splits open, the hasp falls loose, and the
padlock, now nothing but a broken shell, slides to the ground.

Your score has just gone up by one point.

>down
 Church Cellar                                       day three

(opening the trap door first)
As you drop to the floor, the trap door suddenly slams shut above you. You hear
noises outside -- something thumping against the door, and low voices. You hear
someone muttering, and a brief round of unpleasant laughter. Then the voices
drift away.

Church Cellar
Centipedes and beetles scurry away across the rotten floorboards as you shine
your light across the room. Over in the corner sits a hulking shape of black
metal that was probably once a wood-burning furnace; aside from that, the cellar
looks empty. A dark alcove, the shadows within too thick to see through, opens
in the west wall, and a trap door in the ceiling leads back up to the outside.

At the very edge of your light's glow, you can just make out a horribly
suggestive shape lying in the shadows behind the furnace.

>look at shape
 Church Cellar                                       day three

It's the dead body of a woman. Her head has been raggedly hacked away, and her
clothes above the waist are soaked through with blood. As you fight to control
your rising gorge, you note that the body cannot have been here for very long;
the decay, though bad, is not very far advanced. She must have been killed
within the last couple of days at most.

>search shape
 Church Cellar                                       day three

Gingerly, trying to avoid the worst of the blood, you lift the woman's lapel,
hoping to find something -- identification, maybe. Her wallet is missing;
however, you do find, tucked into the pocket of her blazer, a small, steel key.

>put steel key on keyring

The small steel key is now on the keyring.

>look at furnace
 Church Cellar                                       day three

It's a big, pot-bellied iron furnace, blackened from years of use, with a hatch
on one side and numerous twisting pipes which snake out of the top and grope
their way up to the ceiling.

>open hatch
 Church Cellar                                       day three

Your throat tightens as you slowly open the bloodstained hatch...

Slow horror washes over you. You found exactly what you expected to find, of
course. It's the real estate agent's severed head.

 Empty Stairwell                                     day three

Empty Stairwell
This alcove used to house a stairwell leading up and down; now it contains only
a few rotted boards jutting from the walls and an empty shaft dropping down out
of sight. Above you hang the broken-off remains of the stairs leading up to the
ground floor, the last shattered riser only a couple of tantalizing feet out of
reach.

>extinguish lantern

>jump onto riser
 Broken Stairs                                       day three

You take a few steps back, draw in a deep breath, and make a dash for the edge.
At the last possible second you jump, sailing out over the pit as you make a
desperate grab for the bottom riser...

... and catch it.

The riser bends ominously under your weight but doesn't give. Panting, you haul
yourself up onto the creaking stairs.

Broken Stairs
The stairs stop short about seven feet shy of the basement floor, the bottom-
most steps hanging suspended over an empty shaft that descends beyond sight into
the shadowy depths. What's left of the structure creaks and shifts uneasily
under your feet. At the top of the stairs to the north, a doorway opens onto the
ground floor of the church.

The creaking under your feet is getting louder.

>north
 Vestibule                                           day three

Vestibule
A dim antechamber, opening onto the main chapel to the east. To the west, the
main doors to the church have been solidly nailed shut, and through a shadowy
doorway to the south you can see stairs leading down.

Piled in one dusty corner is a heap of old cloth.

>get cloth
 Vestibule                                           day three

You shake the cloth out, revealing it to be a hooded robe.

From the stairwell behind you there is a sudden, painful shriek of nails ripping
out of stone, a loud, protracted splintering, and finally a thunderous crash
that seems to echo up the shaft from far below.

>east
 Chapel                                              day three

Chapel
Broken shards from the shattered the stained glass windows grits under your feet
as you step around rows of overturned pews. The dust and cobwebs have been busy
here, reclaiming another bit of this town's abandoned history. To the west lies
the vestibule; to the east, a small doorway behind the pulpit leads to the back
of the church.

The big wooden cross that once hung above the pulpit has fallen, split in half.

On the pulpit is a huge, black tome.

>read huge tome
It lies open atop the pulpit, thicker than an unabridged dictionary. Its
thousands of yellowed, crinkly pages are bound in a strange black material that
looks like some kind of hide but clearly isn't leather. Your first thought was
that it might be a Bible, but a glance is sufficient to tell you otherwise. The
text within is arranged in two columns, the first in what looks like Latin, the
second a translation in English. There are illustrations, as well: horrible
icons that make your skin crawl to look at.

As you lean closer over the pages to make out the words in this dim light, the
letters seem to writhe and crawl across the page, twisting themselves into
strange combinations, horrible words that you've never read before... and yet,
somehow, you can understand their repulsive meaning. Something about a "Blessed
Event",  which will happen very soon, and a hideous god whose name may not be
spoken...

Is this the book that was preached in this church before it fell to ruin? Are
these the gods these people worshipped? You want to tear your eyes from the page
in revulsion, but some small, gleefully filthy part of you wants to keep
reading, to uncover the secrets that the people of Anchorhead uncovered...

Will you read on?

 Behind the Chapel                                   day three

This little room behind the chapel is hardly bigger than a broom closet. A
ladder bolted to the wall leads up through a hatch, presumably up into the
steeple.

 Steeple                                             day three

Steeple
A tiny space inside the tip of the church's steeple, barely five feet across,
the walls tapering to only two feet across some twelve feet above your head.
There is a narrow window, but it seems to have been painted black at some point.
The only exit seems to be the ladder from which you just emerged.

An old length of rope dangles down from a square hole cut in the ceiling.

>up

You haul yourself up onto the rope, bringing your whole weight to bear. It holds
for about three seconds -- then there is a sharp snap from above you and a
muffled clank. The rope falls, spilling you to the floor amidst an untidy tangle
of coils.

>get rope

places but still sturdy enough.

overlooking an empty shaft, and a fair portion of the railing still nailed to
the wall.

From far below you hear the faint lapping of water.

Hanging From the Rope
Your feet dangle over empty space. Looking down, you can barely make out a faint
glimmer of water, far below.

>drop rope
 Darkness                                            day three

You take a deep breath, shut your eyes tight, say a quick prayer... and let go
of the rope.

The heart-stopping plunge lasts only a second or two before you hit shockingly
cold water. Your flashlight goes out and blackness envelopes you. Water rushes
into your mouth and nose; the stone bottom slams into your side and nearly
knocks the wind out of you... and then you find your feet, and your head breaks
the surface. Blindly, you thrash about until you find higher ground, and you
crawl, choking and sputtering, feeling cold brick beneath your fingers.

Darkness
It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

 Vaulted Tunnel                                      day three

The flashlight must not be quite as waterproof as you originally thought; the
beam flickers unsteadily, and you have to bang it against the palm of your hand
a couple of times to get it to work.

Vaulted Tunnel
The walls of this long, rectangular chamber are made of crumbling brick, not
concrete; most likely it was built at some earlier period than the rest of the
tunnels. The ceiling is lost in darkness above you, but from the sounds of the
echoes it must be pretty high. Water flowing in from the northwestern tunnel has
pooled in a depression sunk into the limestone floor, becoming quite deep near
the far end.

The shattered wreckage of the church stairway lies half submerged in the water-
filled depression. You're lucky to have missed it in your fall.

You can also see a hooded robe here.

 Sewer Tunnel                                        day three

Sewer Tunnel
The tunnel is ankle-deep in brackish water, though raised walkways on either
side provide relatively dry footing. The walls are slick, the air damp and foul.
The main tunnel runs north and southeast. Numerous smaller pipelines lead in all
directions, but all are too small for you to crawl through. Iron rungs embedded
in the wall lead up through an access shaft, back to the surface.

Dripping Tunnel
The ceiling in this north-south tunnel is so low you must bend nearly double to
navigate it. Water drips endlessly through the walls and ceiling, seeping in
through thousands of invisible fissures, the constant plip-plip-plipping echoing
loudly throughout the tunnel. The air is so damp you can hardly breathe. Unless
your sense of direction is mistaken, you must be crossing the Miskaton River --
underneath it.

 Outflow Tunnel                                      day three

Outflow Tunnel
From the smell of it, this must be a sewage outflow tunnel. Filthy water swirls
past a metal grate to the west and eddies around your hands and knees, on which
you are forced to crawl in this cramped cylindrical passageway. To the east, the
tunnel narrows still further, terminating about twenty feet further in a circle
of dim light.
Much of the water is pouring through an open hatch set in the floor of the
tunnel.

You reach the end of the pipe and wriggle your way out, dropping awkwardly to
the sand.

Narrow Beach
This narrow strip of beach is tucked away between two outcroppings in the
predominantly rocky shoreline, accessible only from a steep, muddy slope to the
west. The sand is filthy and strewn with rocks, seaweed, litter and other bits
of storm-tossed detritus.

Near the bottom of the slope, a sewage outflow pipe juts out over the beach,
about three feet above the ground. A thin stream of acrid-smelling sewer water
trickles out over the lip of the pipe, forming a puddle in the sand.

>west
 Alley                                               day three

At the top of the slope you find a tall, wooden fence with a loose board near
the bottom; pushing it aside, you manage to wriggle through the gap.

Alley
This narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of
rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick
walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a
tall, wooden fence.

High up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style
window. One of the garbage cans has been pushed up against the wall directly
underneath it.

A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle
of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of
Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and

rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the
south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and
a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the
north leads down to the local watering hole.

There appears to be a commotion of sorts to the south, where a group of

gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east,
heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in
the other.

 Entrance to the Paper Mill                          day three

As you cross the railroad tracks, the air becomes warmer, more dingy, and
slightly more difficult to breathe.

Entrance to the Paper Mill
The road turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front entrance to
the old paper mill. A gate of heavy iron bars blocks the only opening into this
charred fortress, although an overgrown path leads around the wall to the south.
To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.

>north
 Shanty Town                                         day three

Shanty Town
The road peters out at a wide clearing of rutted mud, flanked by uneven rows of
decrepit, clapboard shacks. The town is quiet, almost deserted; only a few bits
of loose tarpaper blowing listlessly in the wind betray the overall stillness.

The cold wind cuts through your clothes, chilling you to the bone.

>knock on door 11
 Shanty Town                                         day three

After a moment or two of silence, you hear a furtive rattling, and the door
opens a crack to reveal a woman's pale and haggard face. She stares out you with
a mixture of trepidation and mistrust.

>give teddy to woman
(first taking the teddy bear)
The woman's eyes widen in sudden recognition, and she takes the teddy bear from
you, turning it over to read the name stitched on the back. Tears well up in her
eyes, spilling over onto her pale, sunken cheeks. "This is my boy's," she
whispers. "This is Jeffrey's."

She looks at you suddenly. "Where did you find this? Did you find..." but then
she stops. She can see from your face that you have not found her son, only this
one clue. But... even one clue, however tenuous, offers possibility. And the
woman's face softens, just a little bit, with something that you guess hasn't
made its home there in a very, very, long time:

Hope.

"Come in," she says softly. "Thank you for bringing me this. Please, come in."

She steps aside from the door, and you enter her home.

#11 Mill Town Road
A dirty, ramshackle home, scraped together out of the bits and ends of working-
class poverty. The floor is warped and broken wood, bare dirt showing through

the cracks between boards. Rags hang across the window in lieu of curtains. Over
in the far corner is a rickety old stove; in the opposite corner a threadbare
cot; it hits you suddenly that a family of three once lived, slept and ate all
in this single room, which is slightly smaller than your bedroom back at the
house.

The woman watches you expectantly.

On the threadbare cot is a teddy bear.

A set of grime-smeared overalls hangs on a hook next to the front door to the
west.

softly, indicating the stuffed bear. "If you discover anything else, please let
me know."

Flakes of ash drift gently down from the sky like gray snow, coating everything

 Bare Foundations                                    day three

The path curves southwest, leading you into an overgrown area behind the mill.

Bare Foundations
The foundations of an older structure lie crumbling in a sunken square of
ground, hidden away behind the imposing shadow of the mill wall. Weeds push up
through cracked and buckling slabs of concrete; twisted rebar and rusting pipes
poke up like the legs of dead insects. The ruins are surrounded on all sides by
dense thickets, although narrow, overgrown trails lead northeast and southeast
through the underbrush.

Taken.
One of the matches starts to burn.

Maintenance Access Tunnel
You are at the southern end of a long, narrow crawlway leading northward into
the mill. All around you, through the metallic walls, you can hear the
oppressive thumping and grinding of heavy machinery. The air in here is hot and
smells of burnt engine oil.

A large metal valve wheel juts out from the middle of one of the many fat,
sweating pipes lining the walls. Just to its left is a gauge of some sort.

>light lantern

The lantern is now lit.

The noise of machinery is growing steadily louder.

The machines behind the walls are reaching a feverish pitch, and an unpleasant
vibration ripples up and down the crawlway.

The match goes out.

>put towel on valve
 Maintenance Access Tunnel                           day three

(first taking the towel)
You drape the towel over the valve wheel.

Just as the mechanical noises reach a crescendo, the pipes at the north end of
the crawlway suddenly give vent to an enormous gout of superheated steam. The
entire north half of the crawlway is momentarily filled with vapor and intense
heat, which just as quickly dissipates. The noise behind the walls recedes to a
calmer level, and the needle on the gauge swings back down to zero.

>turn wheel
 Maintenance Access Tunnel                           day three

You grip the sides of the wheel -- even through the towel, you can feel the heat
radiating from it -- and haul it clockwise with all your strength. It squeaks
reluctantly at first, then gives all at once. From down the corridor you hear an
enormous hissing rush as steam is vented from the pipes, and the needle in the
gauge drops abruptly down to zero.

Your score has just gone up by one point.

are almost blistering to the touch.

The hatch is closed.

>open hatch
 Maintenance Access Tunnel                           day three

You shove the handle down, and it remains in the lowered position when you let
go. Behind the metal walls you can hear mechanisms clanking into gear, and a
faint, rapid ticking sound.

 Mill Floor                                          day three

(opening the hatch first)
With a sharp tug, the heavy metal door swings open.

Mill Floor
Waves of heat and noise assault you from every corner. Towering above you on all
sides are the enormous vats, presses and sundry machinery, the ever-churning
inner workings of the paper mill. An opening in the base of the south wall leads
back to the maintenance crawlway, and narrow aisles lead in several other
directions through the chugging machinery. A grilled catwalk high over your head
provides a more direct route across the factory; however, you see no way to get
up there from here.

A long chain dangles from overhead, its last few feet pooled on the floor next
to a bank of controls.

>tie chain to me

The waist-high bank has all number of arcane lights, dials and gauges on it;
however, the only two controls that bear mentioning are a lever and a large red
button.

>pull lever
 Catwalk                                             day three

You feel something click as the lever activates a hidden releasing mechanism;
then, suddenly, the chain pulls taut and jerks you off your feet, hauling you up
through the air -- narrowly missing a piece of heavy equipment sailing past you
on its way down -- all the way up to the catwalk, where the chain slows and
finally stops, depositing you safely, though left somewhat breathless, on the
grilled surface.

Catwalk
The catwalk stretches north, a narrow ribbon of metal grillwork dangling fifty
feet over the factory floor and shuddering dangerously in time with the machines
beneath it. There are no railings of any kind. At the far end you can see what
looks like a wide balcony with several large banks of equipment.

A long chain dangles from overhead, its last few feet wrapped securely around
your waist.

 Workshop                                            day three

Workshop
Several workbenches and racks of arcane electronic equipment have been dragged
together to form a sort of open laboratory on this wide balcony overlooking the
mill. A wide table dominates the area, strewn with precision tools, bits of
wire, and scribbled calculations. To the south, a narrow catwalk hangs above the
mill floor, and a metal ladder leads down into the machinery below.

Prominent among the strange tools scattered across the table is a strange
caliper-like instrument.

On the workbenches are some notes and some arcane electronic equipment.

One of the racks contains a number of circular mirrors, stacked side by side
like dishes in a dishwasher.

Tacked up on the wall is a large technical blueprint.

>read notes
 Workshop                                            day three

The notes are a mess of incomprehensibly scrawled numbers; long printouts of
technical data, tangled diagrams and complex formulae. Even if you had the
slightest idea what all the calculations meant, the numbers are barely even
legible.

Lifting up a sheet of cribbed equations, you notice what looks to be a general
memo to all mill workers.

>get caliper
 Workshop                                            day three

You pick up the calipers. Made of stainless steel, molded in a strangely
flowing, almost organic design, the calipers -- if that is what they are --
resemble no other tool you've ever seen. It has three independently adjustable
arms, each ending in a needle-point pincer, which fold back on themselves at
grotesque, asymetrical angles toward a floating center point. There is a
calibrated readout set near the base, which presumably provides a measure of
whatever strange contortion of space is occupied by whatever object is placed
between the pincers at the tool's other end.

You pick up the printed memo. It's a flimsy sheet of paper with the following
message printed on it:

!!NOTICE TO ALL BRETHREN!!
The focusing mirrors must be kept absolutely clean at ALL TIMES. Even the
slightest smudge of dirt or grease can create dangerous instabilities in the
refraction patterns.

All mirrors must receive ionization treatment as a matter of course. As an extra
precaution, however, always use sterilized surgical gloves when handling them.

In the Name of He Who Is Named Not,

>read it
 Workshop                                            day three

You spread out the rolled-up blueprint to look it over.

The blueprint is a technical schematic for some extremely complicated device,
the exact purpose of which is anything but clear. It looks a bit like a
telescope, a bit like a microwave oven turned inside out, and a bit like the
"industrial laser" from Goldfinger. The inner workings of the device involve a
complicated arrangement of lenses and mirrors and a hopeless tangle of circuitry
that vaguely resembles several dozen street maps of Manhattan laid across each
other. Some of the notations on the circuitry don't even look like technical
symbols; they look more like cabbalistic runes.

Next to what must represent the main focusing mirror of the device, someone has
written the number "0.0113"; someone else, in another handwriting, has scratched
that number out and written below it, "0.0162".

free)
You pick up the mirror labeled #2. The mirror is perfectly round and exquisitely
polished. It is very slightly concave on its reflecting surface, distorting the
edges of your face as you stare into it. On the back is a small label with the
number 2 written on it.

>put it in caliper
 Workshop                                            day three

 Mill Floor, on the block of heavy equipment         day three

You slide down the chain, landing awkwardly on the large block of heavy
equipment at the bottom.

Mill Floor, on the block of heavy equipment
Waves of heat and noise assault you from every corner. Towering above you on all
sides are the enormous vats, presses and sundry machinery, the ever-churning
inner workings of the paper mill. An opening in the base of the south wall leads
back to the maintenance crawlway, and narrow aisles lead in several other
directions through the chugging machinery. A grilled catwalk high over your head
provides a more direct route across the factory; however, you see no way to get
up there from here.

 Mill Road                                           day three

As you cross the railroad tracks, the air seems to lift slightly, becoming more
breathable once again.

Mill Road
The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the
south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning
gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east,
heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in
the other.

A distant flicker of movement draws your eyes to the faraway lighthouse. A lone
figure, tiny in the distance, makes its way stealthily around the small spur of
rock at the end of the breakwater and slips inside the door at the tower's base.
It's impossible to see the person's face from this distance, but the hair, the
way he walks... you'd swear it was Michael.

>east
 Breakwater                                          day three

The road heads out over a narrow breakwater jutting out into the ocean.

Breakwater
You are picking your way across the breakwater's bare, rocky spine, where the
road has diminished to little more than a pair of dusty ruts. A hundred yards to
the northeast, at the breakwater's far end, the lonely stone tower of
Anchorhead's lighthouse stands vigil against the ocean.

Another wave crashes against the rocks, sending a cloud of spray into the air.

 At the Foot of the Lighthouse                       day three

At the Foot of the Lighthouse
You stand in a circular clearing among the stones, surrounded on nearly every
side by the sea. Before you looms the ancient, massive lighthouse, a vertiginous
pillar of pale brick jabbing defiantly up at the sky. The road from the
southwest ends here, although it looks as though you could pick your way down
the rocks to the southeast, around the structure's base.

The great bronze door of the lighthouse stands slightly ajar, revealing a narrow
rectangle of blackness within.

>east
 Bottom of the Lighthouse                            day three

Bottom of the Lighthouse
The sound of the ocean is muffled behind the thick cinderblock walls, and the
air is damp and heavy. You can almost feel the weight of two hundred feet of
hoary old whitewashed brick pressing down on you from above. To the west, a
narrow strip of dim light marks the exit. Cracked concrete steps lead up.

 Top of the Lighthouse                               day three

You climb the winding stairs in a gradual spiral around the inner circumference
of the tower, and finally emerge, breathless, at the top.

Top of the Lighthouse
The stairs give onto a wide, circular chamber surrounded by windows. The glass
is old and streaked with grime, but you still have to catch your breath at the
magnificence of the view. In one direction, the dying heath and the stunted
cluster of buildings that is Anchorhead; in the other, the ocean like a vast,
undulating blanket.

Sitting in the middle of the room is what looks like a swivel mount of some
kind, although nothing is mounted on it now. Looking up, you see that it rests
directly below a large, hexagonal skylight.

You hastily descend the winding steps to the bottom.

narrow strip of dim light marks the exit. Cracked concrete steps lead up.

There is a faint scuffing noise from the shadows behind you -- before you can
turn around, something slams into the back of your head with brutal force.
Sparks go off in front of your eyes, and you fall to the cool concrete floor
with the world reeling under you. As you kneel there, dazed and struggling not
to pass out, your assailant walks slowly around you. He pauses, as if wondering
whether or not to finish you off.

Terror and nausea wash over you in alternating waves. You are too weak to look
up and see his face, but you recognize his shoes easily enough. After all, you
helped him pick them out not three weeks ago.

More footsteps come down the stairs, and you sense a number of men standing
around you. "We'll take care of her, Your Holiness," rasps an old, weathered

voice. Rough hands start to drag you to your feet.

"No," says Michael, and the hands pause.

"Your Holiness, she has seen too much," protests the raspy voice. "She must be
killed."

"That won't be necessary," Michael says. "Put her somewhere out of the way,
where she can't get into any more trouble. I'll deal with her myself... after
the Blessed Event."

The horror and pain are too much; the darkness overwhelms you. You try to catch
a glimpse of your husband's face as the men drag you away, but in your clouding
vision all you can see are a pair of burning, red-rimmed eyes...


                             * THE LAST NIGHT *

                   The most merciful thing in the world, I
                   think, is the inability of the human
                   mind to correlate all its contents. We
                   live on a placid island of ignorance in
                   the midst of black seas of infinity,
                   and it was not meant that we should
                   voyage far... but some day the piecing
                   together of dissociated knowledge will
                   open up such terrifying vistas of
                   reality, and of our frightful position
                   therein, that we shall either go mad
                   from the revelation or flee from the
                   deadly light into the peace and safety
                   of a new dark age.

Numb.

You float slowly to consciousness like a bubble rising to the surface of some
warm, thick oil. You are numb.

For several minutes, that is as much as your battered mind can handle, that one
thought: you are numb.

Then your head becomes a bit clearer, and you connect the thought with the
sensations trying to make their way through your foggy brain. You are numb. Your
arms. You can't feel your arms at all.

You try to get up but you can't move; you merely flop over onto your stomach
like a struggling worm. You roll back over and sit up, and at last your vision
clears and you finally get a good look around, and the horror of your situation
finally slams home...

Padded Cell
You are in a padded cell, the kind typically reserved for raving lunatics. The

 Padded Cell                                         the last night

room is barely eight feet by eight feet square, with walls and floor of concrete
covered with thick, quilted padding. The door in the west wall is also covered
with padding, except for a tiny observation window about five feet up, from
which a feeble light trickles in.
