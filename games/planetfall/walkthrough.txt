Another routine day of drudgery aboard the Stellar Patrol Ship Feinstein. This
morning's assignment for a certain lowly Ensign Seventh Class: scrubbing the
filthy metal deck at the port end of Level Nine. With your Patrol-issue self-
contained multi-purpose all-weather scrub brush you shine the floor with a
diligence born of the knowledge that at any moment dreaded Ensign First Class
Blather, the bane of your shipboard existence, could appear.

Deck Nine
This is a featureless corridor similar to every other corridor on the ship. It
curves away to starboard, and a gangway leads up. To port is the entrance to one
of the ship's primary escape pods. The pod bulkhead is closed.

A massive explosion rocks the ship. Echoes from the explosion resound
deafeningly down the halls. The door to port slides open.

Escape Pod
This is one of the Feinstein's primary escape pods, for use in extreme
emergencies. A mass of safety webbing, large enough to hold several dozen
people, fills half the pod. The controls are entirely automated. The bulkhead
leading out is open.

The ship shakes again. You hear, from close by, the sounds of emergency
bulkheads closing.

>get in web


You are now safely cushioned within the web.

The pod door clangs shut as heavy explosions continue to buffet the Feinstein.

>wait


Time passes...

You feel the pod begin to slide down its ejection tube as explosions shake the
mother ship.

>wait


Time passes...

Through the viewport of the pod you see the Feinstein dwindle as you head away.
Bursts of light dot its hull. Suddenly, a huge explosion blows the Feinstein
into tiny pieces, sending the escape pod tumbling away!

As the escape pod tumbles away from the former location of the Feinstein, its
gyroscopes whine. The pod slowly stops tumbling. Lights on the control panel
blink furiously as the autopilot searches for a reasonable destination.

>wait


Time passes...

The auxiliary rockets fire briefly, and a nearby planet swings into view through
the port. It appears to be almost entirely ocean, with just a few visible
islands and an unusually small polar ice cap. A moment later, the system's sun
swings into view, and the viewport polarizes into a featureless black rectangle.

>wait


Time passes...

The main thrusters fire a long, gentle burst. A monotonic voice issues from the
control panel. "Approaching planet...human-habitable."

The pod is buffeted as it enters the planet's atmosphere.

>wait


Time passes...

You feel the temperature begin to rise, and the pod's climate control system
roars as it labors to compensate.

>wait


Time passes...

The viewport suddenly becomes transparent again, giving you a view of endless
ocean below. The lights on the control panel flash madly as the pod's computer
searches for a suitable landing site. The thrusters fire long and hard, slowing
the pod's descent.

>wait


Time passes...

The pod is now approaching the closer of a pair of islands. It appears to be
surrounded by sheer cliffs rising from the water, and is topped by a wide
plateau. The plateau seems to be covered by a sprawling complex of buildings.

>wait


Time passes...

The pod lands with a thud. Through the viewport you can see a rocky cleft and
some water below. The pod rocks gently back and forth as if it was precariously
balanced. A previously unseen panel slides open, revealing some emergency
provisions, including a survival kit and a towel.

>get out of web


As you stand, the pod shifts slightly and you feel it falling. A moment later,
the fall stops with a shock, and you see water rising past the viewport.

>get kit


Taken.

>open door


The bulkhead opens and cold ocean water rushes in!

The pod is now completely submerged, and you feel it smash against underwater
rocks. Bubbles streaming upward past the window indicate that the pod is
continuing to sink.

>out


Underwater
You are momentarily disoriented as you enter the turbulent waters. Currents
buffet you against the sharp rocks of an underwater cliff. A dim light filters
down from above.
