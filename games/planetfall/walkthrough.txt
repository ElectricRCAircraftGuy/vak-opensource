Another routine day of drudgery aboard the Stellar Patrol Ship Feinstein. This
morning's assignment for a certain lowly Ensign Seventh Class: scrubbing the
filthy metal deck at the port end of Level Nine. With your Patrol-issue self-
contained multi-purpose all-weather scrub brush you shine the floor with a
diligence born of the knowledge that at any moment dreaded Ensign First Class
Blather, the bane of your shipboard existence, could appear.

Deck Nine
This is a featureless corridor similar to every other corridor on the ship. It
curves away to starboard, and a gangway leads up. To port is the entrance to one
of the ship's primary escape pods. The pod bulkhead is closed.

>inventory


You are carrying:
  A Patrol uniform (being worn)
  The Patrol uniform contains:
    An ID card
  A chronometer (being worn)
  A Patrol-issue self-contained multi-purpose scrub brush

Ensign First Class Blather swaggers in. He studies your work with half-closed
eyes. "You call this polishing, Ensign Seventh Class?" he sneers. "We have a
position for an Ensign Ninth Class in the toilet-scrubbing division, you know.
Thirty demerits." He glares at you, his arms crossed.

>talk to Blather


Blather shouts "Speak when you're spoken to, Ensign Seventh Class!" He breaks
three pencil points in a frenzied rush to give you more demerits.

>scrub Blather


The Ensign First Class prefers cleaning himself.

>throw brush at Blather


The Patrol-issue self-contained multi-purpose scrub brush bounces off Blather's
bulbous nose. He becomes livid, orders you to do five hundred push-ups, gives
you ten thousand demerits, and assigns you five years of extra galley duty.

>examine uniform


It is a standard-issue one-pocket Stellar Patrol uniform, a miracle of modern
technology. It will keep its owner warm in cold climates and cool in warm
locales. It provides protection against mild radiation, repels all insects,
absorbs sweat, promotes healthy skin tone, and on top of everything else, it is
super-comfy.

Blather, adding fifty more demerits for good measure, moves off in search of
more young ensigns to terrorize.

>examine id card


"STELLAR PATROL
Special Assignment Task Force
ID Number:  6172-531-541"

>examine chronometer


It is a standard wrist chronometer with a digital display. According to the
chronometer, the current time is 4654. The back is engraved with the message
"Good luck in the Patrol! Love, Mom and Dad."

The alien ambassador from the planet Blow'k-bibben-Gordo ambles toward you from
down the corridor. He is munching on something resembling an enormous stalk of
celery, and he leaves a trail of green slime on the deck. He stops nearby, and
you wince as a pool of slime begins forming beneath him on your newly-polished
deck. The ambassador wheezes loudly and hands you a brochure outlining his
planet's major exports.

>talk to ambassador


The ambassador taps his translator, and then touches his center knee to his left
ear (the Blow'k-bibben-Gordoan equivalent of shrugging).

The ambassador asks if you are performing some sort of religious ceremony.

>attack ambassador


The ambassador is startled, and emits an amazing quantity of slime which spreads
across the section of the deck you just polished.

The ambassador introduces himself as Br'gun-te'elkner-ipg'nun.

>scrub slime


Whew. You've cleaned up maybe one ten-thousandth of the slime. If you hurry, it
might be all cleaned up before Ensign Blather gets here.

The ambassador introduces himself as Br'gun-te'elkner-ipg'nun.

>ask ambassador for celery


The ambassador seems willing to let you eat some of it, but I doubt he wants to
part with the entire stalk.

The ambassador grunts a polite farewell, and disappears up the gangway, leaving
a trail of dripping slime.

>read brochure


"The leading export of Blow'k-bibben-Gordo is the adventure game

Buy one today. Better yet, buy a thousand."

Dropped.

A massive explosion rocks the ship. Echoes from the explosion resound
deafeningly down the halls. The door to port slides open.

>west


Escape Pod
This is one of the Feinstein's primary escape pods, for use in extreme
emergencies. A mass of safety webbing, large enough to hold several dozen
people, fills half the pod. The controls are entirely automated. The bulkhead
leading out is open.

The ship shakes again. You hear, from close by, the sounds of emergency
bulkheads closing.

>get in web


You are now safely cushioned within the web.

The pod door clangs shut as heavy explosions continue to buffet the Feinstein.

>wait


Time passes...

You feel the pod begin to slide down its ejection tube as explosions shake the
mother ship.

>wait


Time passes...

Through the viewport of the pod you see the Feinstein dwindle as you head away.
Bursts of light dot its hull. Suddenly, a huge explosion blows the Feinstein
into tiny pieces, sending the escape pod tumbling away!

As the escape pod tumbles away from the former location of the Feinstein, its
gyroscopes whine. The pod slowly stops tumbling. Lights on the control panel
blink furiously as the autopilot searches for a reasonable destination.

>wait


Time passes...

The auxiliary rockets fire briefly, and a nearby planet swings into view through
the port. It appears to be almost entirely ocean, with just a few visible
islands and an unusually small polar ice cap. A moment later, the system's sun
swings into view, and the viewport polarizes into a featureless black rectangle.

>wait


Time passes...

The main thrusters fire a long, gentle burst. A monotonic voice issues from the
control panel. "Approaching planet...human-habitable."

>wait

The pod is buffeted as it enters the planet's atmosphere.

>wait


Time passes...

You feel the temperature begin to rise, and the pod's climate control system
roars as it labors to compensate.

>wait


Time passes...

The viewport suddenly becomes transparent again, giving you a view of endless
ocean below. The lights on the control panel flash madly as the pod's computer
searches for a suitable landing site. The thrusters fire long and hard, slowing
the pod's descent.

>wait


Time passes...

The pod is now approaching the closer of a pair of islands. It appears to be
surrounded by sheer cliffs rising from the water, and is topped by a wide
plateau. The plateau seems to be covered by a sprawling complex of buildings.

>wait


Time passes...

The pod lands with a thud. Through the viewport you can see a rocky cleft and
some water below. The pod rocks gently back and forth as if it was precariously
balanced. A previously unseen panel slides open, revealing some emergency
provisions, including a survival kit and a towel.

>read towel


(Taking the towel first)
"S.P.S. FEINSTEIN
  Escape Pod #42
   Don't Panic!"

>get out of web


As you stand, the pod shifts slightly and you feel it falling. A moment later,
the fall stops with a shock, and you see water rising past the viewport.

>get kit


Taken.

>open kit


Opening the survival kit reveals a blob of green goo, a blob of brown goo, and a
blob of red goo.

The pod is now completely submerged, and you feel it smash against underwater
rocks. Bubbles streaming upward past the window indicate that the pod is
continuing to sink.

>open door


The bulkhead opens and cold ocean water rushes in!

>out


Underwater
You are momentarily disoriented as you enter the turbulent waters. Currents
buffet you against the sharp rocks of an underwater cliff. A dim light filters
down from above.

>up


Crag
You have reached a cleft in the cliff wall where the island rises from the
water. The edge of the cleft displays recently exposed rock where it collapsed
under the weight of the escape pod. About two meters below, turbulent waters
swirl against sharp rocks. A small structure clings to the face of the cliff
about eight meters above you. Even an out-of-shape Ensign Seventh Class could
probably climb up to it.

>up


Balcony
This is an octagonal room, half carved into and half built out from the cliff
wall. Through the shattered windows which ring the outer wall you can see ocean
to the horizon. A weathered metal plaque with barely readable lettering rests
below the windows. The language seems to be a corrupt form of Galalingua. A
steep stairway, roughly cut into the face of the cliff, leads upward. A rocky
crag can be seen about eight meters below.

>up


Winding Stair
The middle of a long, steep stairway carved into the face of a cliff.

>up


Courtyard
You are in the courtyard of an ancient stone edifice, vaguely reminiscent of the
castles you saw during your leave on Ramos Two. It has decayed to the point
where it can probably be termed a ruin. Openings lead north and west, and a
stairway downward is visible to the south.

>drop id card


Dropped.

>drop towel


Dropped.

>north


Plain Hall
This is a featureless hall leading north and south. Although the hallway is old
and dusty, the construction is of a much more modern style than the castle to
the south. A similar hall branches off to the northeast.

>ne


Rec Corridor
This is a wide, east-west hallway. Portals lead north and south, and another
corridor branches southwest.

>east


Mess Corridor
This is a wide, east-west hallway with a large portal to the south. A small door
to the north is closed and hooked with a simple steel padlock which is also
closed.

>east


Dorm Corridor
This is a wide, east-west hallway with openings to the north and south. To the
east, the corridor stretches off into the distance. That section of the hallway
is lined with a motorized walkway (no longer running) that was probably intended
to transport people or cargo down that tremendously long hall.

>east


You walk down the long, featureless hallway for a long time. Finally, you see an
intersection ahead...

Corridor Junction
A north-south corridor intersects the main corridor here. To the west, the main
corridor extends as far as you can see; a non-working walkway from that
direction ends here. To the east, the corridor widens into a well-lit area.

>south


Mech Corridor North
Entrances to rooms lie to the east and west from this north-south hall.

Mech Corridor
Entrances to rooms lie to the east and west from this north-south hall.

Mech Corridor South
The corridor ends here with doorways to the southwest, south, and southeast.

>sw


Tool Room
This is apparently a storage room for tools. Exits lead northeast and east.
A small device, labelled "Akmee Portabul Laazur", is resting on one of the lower
shelves.
On an upper shelf is a metal bar, curved into a U-shape.
Sitting on the floor below the lowest shelf is a large glass flask.

>examine device


The laser, though portable, is still fairly heavy. It has a long, slender barrel
and a dial with six settings, labelled "1" through "6." This dial is currently
on setting 5. There is a depression on the top of the laser which contains an
old battery.

>examine flask


The flask has a wide mouth and looks large enough to hold one or two liters. It
is made of glass, or perhaps some tough plastic.

>get bar


Taken.

Admin Corridor South
This section of hallway seems to have suffered some minor structural damage. The
walls are cracked, and a jagged crevice crosses the floor. An opening leads east
and the corridor heads north and south.

>hold bar over crevice


With a spray of dust and a loud clank, a piece of metal leaps from the crevice
and affixes itself to the magnet. It is a steel key! With a tug, you remove the
key from the magnet.

Storage West
This is a small room obviously intended as a storage area.
A heavy-duty extendable ladder is leaning against the rear wall.
On a small shelf is a large, unopened tin can. It has a plain white label which
reads "Spam and Egz."

>drop key


Dropped.

>get ladder


Taken.
