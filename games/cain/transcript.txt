THE PROVOST TOPS off your brandy and invites you to sit.  "The question has
bedeviled the Academy's Scholastics since this institution was founded," he
says with a weary sigh.  "What is the Mark of Cain?"

The Provost is a gray man, whiskered and immobile.  He administers the Academy
from his padded chair--ratty blanket thrown over his lap--by scratching
messages on parchment and throwing them out the window to his secretaries in
the courtyard below.

"The Academy has already sent two of our best," he says.  "They failed to
return.  We consider them lost.  You must do better."

You, a novitiate Indagator, investigate for the Academy all manner of
esoterica.  Usually the questions revolve around the finer points of philosophy
and science debated by the Scholastics.  This riddle, though--the Mark of
Cain--is monumental.  It is the oldest mystery in known history.

The Provost breaks the silence with a deep and gravelly voice.  "Indagator, you
are charged with resolving this ancient question.  Stand and prepare yourself!"

Summoning all his powers, he claps his hands--and in an instant, you are sent
back in time...to the beginning...

I. A YOUNG EARTH

East of Eden
A fine hazy mist shrouds the sky, making the sun little more than a smeary
torch in a smoke-filled room.  The air is redolent with a sour aroma.  The
world feels fresh and new.

On your wrist is the orbis bracelet given to you by the Provost before you were
sent to this time.  You must not lose the bracelet; it's your only way back to
the Academy.

Before you, a circuitous path plunges eastward into the windswept wilderness.
It is this direction you will need to travel to begin your inquiry.

Behind you, to the distant west, lies Eden.

[Type ABOUT for more information on this game.]

>east
A tree
In a break from the rugged and stark terrain, a magnificent tree rises
alongside the path.  A crow descends from high above and alights upon its
lowest branch.

Nestled against the roots of the tree sits a leather rucksack.

In the rucksack you see some arsenic, some lymph, some black bile, some phlegm,
and some yellow bile.

The Academy has provided well.  This rucksack will you help you with your
inquiry.  As you travel, you should discover more of the tools you will require
to complete your inquiry and prepare your report for the Provost.

The way continues east.

>get rucksack
You heave up the weighty rucksack and sling it over your shoulder.

>look rucksack
This unique rucksack of tanned leather and stitching holds several secured
phials.  Once stored in it, liquids will not spill or mix while traveling.  In
the rucksack you see some arsenic, some lymph, some black bile, some phlegm,
and some yellow bile.

>east
As you travel, your thoughts wander to the plight of Adam and Eve, the first
humans created and parents of all Mankind.

They were brought forth in the paradise Eden.  They lived a life of pure ease,
only to be banished to the wilderness for a single weakness.  This path you
walk would have been the one they followed as they searched for a new home...

A Young Earth
Your journey brings you to the mouth of a turbulent valley and a terrible
sight: The valley walls and floor have broken open, allowing foul steam and
gases from the underworld to escape high into the air.

Here lies yet another provision from the Academy for your inquiry: On the
ground near the magma flow is a pulverulent cloth.

The way continues east and west.  Any travel south through the valley is
blocked by the magma flow.

>get cloth
You pick up the pulverulent cloth.

A great grumbling announces itself beneath the ground, and you find yourself
swaying about as though on a ship deck.  A moment later, the disturbance
ceases.

>look cloth
This pulverulent cloth is sewn for chemists and doctors to carry powders and
herbals.  It's woven to wick away moisture and keep its contents dry under
normal conditions.  Submerged, however, the powders will be ruined.

>east
Your thoughts return to the Provost's words in his quarters:

"Recall that Eve birthed two sons," the Provost told you.  "Cain, the eldest,
tilled the fields.  Younger brother Abel tended the flocks.  Until..." He
trails off.

"Cain murdered Abel," you said to complete his thought.

"The first murder in all of history.  As punishment, the Creator cursed Cain to
wander the Earth to the end of his days.  Cain was marked to prove he
introduced murder into our world.  The mark served to protect Cain from others
taking vengeance upon him."

"Why do that?  Why protect such evil?"

The Provost emitted a gravelly murmur.  "Vengeance was the Creator's."

Approaching the river
The steady rushing of a river comes from the east.  A turbulent valley of magma
and steam roils to the west.

Lying here is a thick tome bound in calf-skin.  It's the Pharmakon, a formulary
and another provision made by the Academy for your inquiry.

This book may be the most valuable possession they delivered for your work.

>get Pharmakon
With a grunt, you pick up the cumbersome and dusty tome.

>look Pharmakon
The Pharmakon is a formulary compiled over the ages, from the ancients to the
modern Scholastics of the Academy.  It's a massive, unwieldy reference of fine-
print, formulae, cross-references, and paper dust.

It's also a compendium of history, knowledge, insight: Wisdom earned and
expressed.

Entries are poorly organized, as the Pharmakon is revised continuously as
discoveries are made and old knowledge found undependable.

It's not intended to be read cover-to-cover.  Rather, it should be consulted by
topic.

While the formulary is organized in haphazard fashion, its initial entry is
worthy of your attention: First Principles.

The initial entry in the formulary is First Principles.

>look up First Principles
(the Pharmakon)
"First Principles" acts as a kind of introduction for this edition of the
Pharmakon.  It was penned by Hester IV of Minscip, an old cur and one of the
original Indagatores the Academy produced.  He was also your mentor, and a
trusted one at that.

He uses the opportunity of an introduction to produce a screed on the loose
ethics of your chosen profession:

"More than the what, the Indagator determines the why: the motivations; the
reasoning; the rationalizations; the madness.

"The greatest tool available to the investigator is combining essences to form
compounds, which unlock old memories, reveal hidden details, and even reshape
physical matter.  Researching the Pharmakon is vital to the success of your
inquiry!

"Good luck, Indagator," Hester IV of Minscip writes in his hasty but flowing
penmanship.  "TRUTH is our shared pursuit.  It is ignorance we fight, to light
the way toward a more complete understanding of our fellow man and woman!"

c.f., Indagator, essence

>look up Indagator
(the Pharmakon)
Indagator: The investigator; the observer; the questioner & the doubter.

An Indagator examines all, determines the significance, and forgets nothing.
MEMORIES and RECALL are two of your most important powers.

"SACRIFICE is--alas!--also a necessity of our chosen profession," Hester IV of
Minscip adds.

c.f., essence, alchemy, sacrifice

>memories
So far, you've gathered no historical revelations about your inquiry.

>look up essence
(the Pharmakon)
Essences are the backbone of the Indagator's compounds, and thereby his or her
inquiry.

While a constellation of essences exist for medicinal, soothsaying, and other
scientific pursuits, for the Indagator only three varieties are pertinent:

   * remedy
   * poison
   * excipient

Compounds are formed by applying two or more of these essences to an object or
a surface.  When the correct combination is applied, the mixture will trigger
the desired effect.

If the wrong compound is applied, the mixture will dissolve, leaving nothing
but a sense of waste.

c.f., remedy, poison, excipient

>look up alchemy
(the Pharmakon)
Alchemy is a broad and learned field, but the Indagator has only to be
acquainted with a handful of simple compounds for success in an inquiry.  Those
compounds are--

Here the ink on the page blurs and smudges, no doubt due to some careless
scribe spilling his tea on the page, or one of the Academy's absentminded
Scholastics shaving while poring over its secrets.  (Not that they shave that
often; once a year, perhaps, at most.)

When the blurred ink and scarred paper settles at the bottom of the page, only
this warning remains:

"Compounds may be applied for effect once and only once.  Subsequent attempts
will merely result in loss of the applied essences."

>look up sacrifice
(the Pharmakon)
Hester IV of Miscip writes:

"Sacrifice is the defining characteristic of the Indagator's excipient essence,
of which no other profession uses in quite the same manner or to the same
effect.

"Sacrifice is the defining characteristic of the Indagator as well, for every
inquiry requires sacrifice--in the name of TRUTH!  Onward!"

c.f., Indagator, Truth, excipient

>look up remedy
(the Pharmakon)
A remedy is a vital and promotive essence in compounds.

Remedies are blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm.

It is no coincidence that all four remedies are also the Four Humours.
Understand the Four Humours, and you will understand the use of remedies and
poisons.

c.f., poison, excipient, Four Humours

>look up poison
(the Pharmakon)
A poison is a vital but countering essence in compounds.

Poisons are lymph, chamomile, arsenic, and sage.

c.f., remedy, excipient

Your training at the Academy informs you that you should concentrate on
completing your inquiry, not searching the Pharmakon round and round.

[Don't worry about learning everything the Pharmakon has to offer right away.
You'll have plenty of chances to consult it later.]

>look up excipient
(the Pharmakon)
An excipient is an essence sacrificed in a compound to hold together the remedy
and the poison, which, by their nature, are repelled.

Excipients are salt & sulfur; grease & ash; wax & royal jelly; and spirits &
mercury.

Hester IV of Minscip can't help but add in the margin: "Power lies not in the
remedy or the poison, but in the sacrifice!"

c.f., remedy, poison, sacrifice

>look up Truth
(the Pharmakon)
"The pursuit of TRUTH is the only footrace worth running," Hester IV of Minscip
writes.  "Do not block the way of inquiry!

"And that is all I have to say on the subject."

>look up Four Humours
(the Pharmakon)
The Four Humours represent the balancing fluids intrinsic to the human body.
Every living being contains all four; it is when the Humours are unbalanced
that one may overtake the others, leading to excessive behavior and damaging
thoughts.

The Four Humours are:

   * blood which makes one sanguine
   * yellow bile which makes one choleric
   * black bile which makes one melancholic
   * phlegm which makes one phlegmatic

Note that all four are remedies in the Indagator tool kit.

Hester IV of Minscip adds in the margin: "Early inquiries into Adam, Eve, Cain,
& Abel indicates each is associated with a different Humour.  Learning each
family member's Humour would be a tour de force for any Indagator!"

c.f., remedy, Three Primes

>look up Three Primes
(the Pharmakon)
The Three Primes (tria prima) represent the fullness of Life, the potential of
the human spirit, and the unity of Mankind.  The primes are located in salt,
sulfur, and mercury.

As all three are excipients, they are sacrificed when formulating compounds.
Their very nature represents the nature of the Indagator: SACRIFICE.

The significance of the Three Primes versus the balance of the Four Humours
have been hotly debated since the earliest stirrings of Scholasticism.

c.f., excipient, Four Humours, sacrifice

The scolding voice of Hester IV of Minscip rings out across your thoughts: "Do
not waste precious time lost in the pages of the Pharmakon!  Your inquiry
awaits!  ONWARD!"

>east
You recall the Provost throwing up his liver-spotted hands when you last spoke
to him:

"The historical record offers no clue to the form of Cain's rude mark!" he
said.  "Is it a scar on his face, or the color of his hair, or a horn sprouting
from his forehead?  To know this is to better understand the true nature of
evil, for Cain was Perdition itself!"

This is the question you must answer.  It is why you've been sent back to this
time, the beginning of mankind's existence on Earth.

Crossing
A roaring river of whitewater and coursing rapids terminates your path through
the wilderness.  A lean, frayed rope bridge crosses east to the opposite bank.
Otherwise, your only other path is west, the way you came.

With a showy beating of its wings, a crow swoops down and settles among the
topmost branches of a nearby eucalyptus.

Lying on the river's bank is an oversized vellum envelope with a prominent blue
seal.  You will need it to issue your final report to the Academy.

>get envelope
You take the envelope.  The stiffness of the vellum reminds you of the
Academy's formality.  You think of the elderly and wise Provost, of your
teacher Hester IV of Minscip, and of the steady purpose of the Academy's
Scholastics.  You do not want to let them down.

A crow high in the tree preens its feathers and shakes itself.

>look envelope
The envelope is of stiff vellum folded into shape and held fast with an
embossed seal.

The Provost expects you to break the seal when you're prepared to report your
findings to the Academy.

Choose your time wisely.  You are the final Indagator the Academy can afford to
send for this investigation.  Breaking the seal is tantamount to declaring your
inquiry is completed.

>east
Bearing some trepidation, you plant a foot on the rope bridge, then the other.
Your crossing begins with careful, mindful steps.

Three-quarters of the way across, your fears fade.  Perhaps your time at the
Academy among its soft scholars has left you suspicious of rural craftsmanship.
After all, you made it this far without--

Strands of the rope start unwinding beneath your feet.  You impulsively grapple
for the hand-hold, but it too buckles.  Madly you scramble to hold onto your
possessions as the rope gives way.  You tumble into the ice-cold river...

II. A FRAGILE EARTH

You're washed far downstream before you manage to grasp solid rock and pull
yourself from the river.  You trudge up the eastern bank drenched to the bone
and grouching about "rural craftsmanship."

After some time in the sun, your equipment and essences are dry and intact.
The frigid river has left you shivering uncontrollably, however.

Worse: You lost your orbis bracelet in the water.  Without it, you have no way
to return to the Academy.

You struggle to recall why you accepted this task from the Provost.  You
struggle equally to grasp why he would select you, a novitiate so green in the
science of investigation.  Perhaps after losing two Indagatores to the inquiry,
he found himself facing a dearth of volunteers.

Plain
You're standing on the edge of a flooded plain.  A stagnant pond fed by the
redirected river makes a murky mirror across the plain.  An irrigation ditch
controlled by a sluice gate leads to a distant field of wheat covering much of
the valley floor.

To the southeast is a winding footpath leading up an incline, while northeast
of here is a squat cave set in the side of the bank.

Far to the north, you make out a settlement around an enormous cedar tree.  The
way north is blocked by the pond.

A Fragile Earth
Peering down from atop an incline, you behold yet another awesome spectacle in
the distance: The earth ripped open and the underworld's molten rivers and
miasma escaping to the surface.  This young Earth suffers teething pains, and
its tantrum is most awful.

The narrow footpath continues down the hill into a chasm, or northwest back to
the sluice gate.

A deep blue gem strung on a loop of leather cord lies on the ground.  It's
another provision from the Academy.

>wear gem
(first taking the lumens gem)

You put the leather cord around your neck.  The lumens gem hangs at your
sternum.

The breeze carries up from the chasm below the stench of rotten eggs.

>down
Sulfur deposits
In this wide and arid chasm you spy the telltale yellow chalk of sulfur
spilling down the slope.

A winding path leads up out of the chasm.

>collect sulfur
You collect all the sulfur you can find, prepare it for use, and add it to the
pulverulent cloth.

You notice you're slightly warm, and feeling an unexpected soreness in your jaw
and neck muscles.  That dunk in the ice-cold river must have impaired your
constitution more than you first thought.

To the southeast is a winding footpath leading up an incline, while northeast

The sluice glows a clear blue hue.  The lumens gem is telling you to examine
the sluice closer.

>look gate
A sluice gate with a wood lever controls whether the river water can enter the
irrigation ditch.  The gate's closed, causing the swollen river to flood the
plain.

The sluice glows a clear blue hue.  The lumens gem has detected powerful
memories stored within this surface.  You should apply an ostendo compound to
learn how to unlock them.  They may potentially help you with your inquiry.

[Use LOOK UP OSTENDO to learn what substances you'll need to unlock the
memories stored in the sluice.]

>look up ostendo
(the Pharmakon)
Strong emotional reactions are embedded in surfaces near the source of the
psychic disturbance.

Once an ostendo compound is applied to such a surface, the Indagator will
receive an Inspiration for unlocking the revelation embedded within it.

Note that ostendo, as with all compounds, should only be applied once.
Applying the same compound to the same surface more than once only serves to
waste essences.

Hester IV of Minscip adds a footnote in his peculiar scrawl:

"While detailing the ingredients ostendo requires should be unnecessary for any
Indagator worth his salt, I will transcribe them here to quiet the countless
students who bang on my door at all hours pleading for its formulation: salt &
sulfur.  Now let me sleep!"

[Alas, the Academy didn't send provisions for every ingredient you'll need to
complete your inquiry.  You have some sulfur.  Search around and see if you can
locate some salt.]

convex by the river.

A gash up the side of the grotto reveals a bed of crystal salt embedded in the

The sluice glows a clear blue hue.

[You should APPLY SALT TO SLUICE and APPLY SULFUR TO SLUICE to activate an
ostendo compound.]

>apply salt and sulfur to sluice
You spread some of the salt and the sulfur on the sluice.

The ostendo compound blends and dissolves, preparing to reveal the next steps
for unlocking the revelations burned into the sluice...

In your ear comes a disembodied whisper: "Phlegm and sulfur."

Applying these two essences to the sluice will unlock the memories embedded
within it.

[You may now refer to the ostendo compound by name.  Using it has seared its
list of essences into your memory.  For example, you may APPLY OSTENDO TO
SHOVEL if the need arises.]

>apply phlegm and sulfur to sluice
You spread some of the phlegm and the sulfur on the sluice.

The admixture blends, swells, bubbles, seizes up--

The ethereal voice of a young man appears in your mind.  It is a voice recorded
in the past:

After Father and I dug this trench to irrigate my wheat and vegetables, brother
Abel made a discovery: When the sluice is closed, the field floods deep enough
for his flock to drink from.  This saves him half a day of shepherding them
down to the river and back.  My crops suffer for his laziness.  I have
repeatedly warned him not to lock the sluice closed without my permission.

Mother and Father will not intervene.  He is the youngest son.  They are
intoxicated by his charms and soothed by his assurances that he bears no ill
will.

And yet here I find my field dry as dust and the sluice gate closed.  He has
managed to jam it shut with a wedge, to prevent me from undoing his handiwork.
He is without shame!

The voice fades off, leaving you with an electric charge of scholarly
excitement.  The young man speaks of his brother Abel.  "Mother" is Eve, the
first Woman to walk the Earth.  "Father" is Adam, the first Man.  This is
Cain's voice!

[Use MEMORIES to list all revelations you've surfaced in your inquiry.]

>look pond
With the sluice closed, the swollen river is backed up and flooding the plain.
In the murky still pond you faintly make out a wooden wedge jammed into the
bottom of the sluice gate.  You should be able to reach it.

>remove wedge
You manage to remove the wedge from the gate's jamb, but you lose the slippery
thing in the murky water.  The gate should be free to move now, though.

>pull lever
With a great deal of effort, you succeed in pulling the sluice lever back.  The
gate opens and water rushes into the irrigation ditch.

Within a few minutes, the pond has drained enough for you to move north across
the plain.

>north
River bank
You recognize this to be the opposite bank of the river crossing you attempted.
The rope bridge unraveled entirely and was swept downstream with you.

North of here stands a small settlement.  No fence or markings, only a few
buildings around a grand cedar tree.  To the south is a sluice gate.

Down the rushing river flows ice-cold water.

As though demonstrating the ease of fording a river, the crow launches from the
far bank, soars over the river in a geometric arc, and lands gracefully a few
feet from you.

Without a glance, it emits a berating caaaw at you.

It makes another showy beating of its wings, lifts off, and flies away.

>north
As you approach the settlement, you surmise it was abandoned some time ago.
Time has worn down everything left behind...

Well
A ring of rock surrounds a well in the ground.  A crossbeam dissects the well's
opening in half.  From the depths below comes the echoing trickle of slow-
running water.

The river is south of here, while a towering cedar is to the east.  Beyond it
is a clearing and some ramshackle buildings.

The well glows a clear blue hue.

It would be wise to examine the well closer, in case it may yield any insights
into your inquiry.

>apply ostendo to well
You spread some of the salt and the sulfur on the well.

The ostendo compound blends and dissolves, preparing to reveal the next steps
for unlocking the revelations burned into the well...

In your ear comes a disembodied whisper: "Yellow bile and ash."

Applying this mixture to the well will unlock the memories embedded within.
Now, if you could only find some ash...

>east
Foot of the great cedar tree
You're standing at the foot of a great cedar tree.  Its leafy branches reach
all directions overhead.

The crow alights upon one of the lower branches.  It caws twice at you and
ruffles its wings with a satisfied shrug.  You reckon you could climb to the
tree's lower branches, if you so desired, if only to give the crow a piece of
your mind.

A well stands to the west.  To the south begins an expansive tilled field.
East is a fire pit surrounded by some small buildings.

The Academy has provided once more.  A string of wood cups braided together by
a strand of twine is piled on the ground at the foot of the tree.

>get cups
You pick up the braid of cups.

The crow soars about in the sky for a few moments, as though stretching its
wings, before returning to its branch.

>east
Fire pit
This clearing, along with the great cedar tree to the west, feels to be the hub
of the settlement and its surrounding areas.

In the center of the clearing stands a large fire pit surrounded by a ring of
stones.  The middle is scorched out from much use, but the pit is cold.

East of here, a thatch mud hovel and a gray tent are built against the side of
a hill.  To the south stands a dilapidated wood shack.

Far to the northeast, you discern what appears to be a landslide.

The fire pit stones glow a clear blue hue.

The crow launches from the tree, flies a roundabout loop in the hazy sky, and
returns to its perch.

>get ash
You collect all the ash you can find, prepare it for use, and add it to the
pulverulent cloth.

>apply ostendo to stones
You spread some of the salt and the sulfur on the fire pit stones.

The ostendo compound blends and dissolves, preparing to reveal the next steps
for unlocking the revelations burned into the fire pit stones...

In your ear comes a disembodied whisper: "Arsenic, sulfur, and Adam's Humour."

Stones will speak the truth, but you must coax it from them.

Besides arsenic and sulfur, you must determine which of the Four Humours
dominated Adam's temperament.  Studying the Pharmakon may be of help.  Good
places to start would be the entries on Adam and the Four Humours.

Unlocking other revelations around the settlement may shine a light on the
matter as well.

>look up Adam
(the Pharmakon)
The first Man to walk the Earth; the Father of Mankind.  Adam's sin, along with
Eve's, led to their expulsion from paradise.

Sired sons Cain and Abel, and eldest daughter Awan, among other children.

The first four family members--Adam, Eve, Cain, & Abel--each represent a
Humour, and their temperaments, moods, and emotions are defined as such.  None
of the family members share a Humour.

Scholastics speculate Adam was phlegmatic: Reserved, thoughtful, and patient.
The matter remains unknown at the moment, however.

Your inquiry has determined that the well has a revelation locked within it.

>look well
The stones surrounding the perimeter of the well are mostly egg-shaped river
rock smoothed by erosion.  Judging by the shovel marks cut into the inner walls
of the well, the well was dug by hand, and is not a natural formation the
settlers here took advantage of.

A thick wood crossbeam is mounted over the well.

The compound needed to release the revelation locked within is composed of
yellow bile and ash.

>apply yellow bile and ash to well
You spread some of the yellow bile and the ash on the well.

The admixture blends, swells, bubbles, seizes up--

The young man's voice--Cain--begins speaking in your mind about his father,
Adam:

Father believes with enough contrition, the Creator will permit us to return to
the paradise Eden.  He has begun a hard fast, consuming only sips of rainwater
and nibbles of honeycomb.  It has made him weak.  His ribs press into his skin
and reveal the cage encasing his heart.

Fasting, hard work, and daily exhortations to the Creator have driven Father to
the precipice.  His eyes bulge egg-like from their sockets.  White foam flecks
the corners of his mouth.  He rarely speaks, but when he does, he rants and
raves, permitting none of us to get in so much as two words.

Unlike Mother, he refuses to discuss his time in the garden paradise before
their sins drove them out.  Hard work is his silent contrition for his error--
daily, grinding, maddening hard work.

This suggests much about Adam's temperament--and his Humour.  Obsession driven
to madness is a well-established behavior of an overly choleric person.  The
Pharmakon has more information.

>look up choleric
(the Pharmakon)
The humour yellow bile makes one choleric.  It is countered by the chamomile
poison.

The choleric are characterized as decisive, analytic, and "quick on their
feet."  They prefer action over contemplation.  Unlike melancholics, they live
in the moment rather than the past.

An excess of cholera leads to a depletion of the choleric's admirable
qualities.  Decisiveness becomes quick-tempered; analytics are surrendered to
instinct.  Anger and snap decisions become their norm.  Madness is common.

Lost in thought for a moment, your focus snaps back when the crow's shrill call
cuts through the air.

>east
Foot of the great cedar tree
You're standing at the foot of a great cedar tree.  Its leafy branches reach
all directions overhead.

A crow sits on one of the lower tree branches.  You could reach it if you
climbed up.

A well stands to the west.  To the south begins an expansive tilled field.
East is a fire pit surrounded by some small buildings.

>east
Fire pit
This clearing, along with the great cedar tree to the west, feels to be the hub
of the settlement and its surrounding areas.

In the center of the clearing stands a large fire pit surrounded by a ring of
stones.  The middle is scorched out from much use, but the pit is cold.

East of here, a thatch mud hovel and a gray tent are built against the side of
a hill.  To the south stands a dilapidated wood shack.

Far to the northeast, you discern what appears to be a landslide.

The fire pit stones glow a clear blue hue.

Your inquiry has determined that the fire pit stones have a revelation locked
within them.

>apply arsenic, sulfur, and yellow bile to stones
You spread some of the arsenic, the sulfur, and the yellow bile on the fire pit
stones.

The admixture blends, swells, bubbles, seizes up--

Cain's voice appears in your thoughts, a message from the past:

Each night, Father ignites the Great Fire.  On haunches before the crackling
flames, he supplicates himself to the Creator.  His cries for forgiveness echo
off the mountains to the south.

Some mornings, I find him passed out before the Fire's dying embers.  He lies
naked and uncovered, having worked himself into a froth before losing
consciousness.

Once, in a raving lather, Adam cried out to the dancing Fire: "The world was
created in goodness!  So it must be governed according to the fruit of good
works!"

Father throws salt into the Fire to divine our family's future.  He wishes to
foresee if we will be permitted to return to the garden paradise.  And Adam has
divined a magick: He applies salt and ash to the pit to ignite the Fire.

In his mania he ignores the Crow, who trills down at him from the Great Tree.
The Crow is scolding Adam for resorting to the black arts.

I know this: Ignore the Crow at your own peril.

When Cain's voice fades off, you realize the "magick" Adam learned is, in fact,
established science.  It is known as encyp, and it is recorded in the
Pharmakon.

[You've unlocked another revelation.  Use MEMORIES for all revelations you may
recall.]

>look up encyp
(the Pharmakon)
Producing fire is a remedial skill explained by any proficient woodsman or
soldier.  However, restoring an extinguished fire without the aid of flint or
spark is a trick most rare.

The alchemical encyp compound is trivial: salt & ash.  The compound is only
effective for restoring fire in a location where a previous fire burned, such
as a hearth or a scorched field.

As is his wont, Hester IV of Minscip cannot help but add in the margin:
"Alomancy--salt divination--has an ancient provenance.  It is often coupled
with pyromancy, that is, fire divination.  Restoring a fire regularly used for
alomancy can reveal much about the alomancer and his or her flock."
