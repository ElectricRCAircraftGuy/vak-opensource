                 And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:
                 But unto Cain and to his offering He had not respect.
                                 -Genesis 4:4-5, King James Version


                 Then ALLAH sent a crow searching in the ground
                 to show [Cain] how to hide the disgrace of his brother.
                                 -Quran 5:31, Sahih International


                 "From this time forth...thou shalt be called Perdition."

                 And Cain said unto the LORD,

THE PROVOST TOPS off your brandy and invites you to sit.  "The question has
bedeviled the Academy's Scholastics since this institution was founded," he
says with a weary sigh.  "What is the Mark of Cain?"

The Provost is a gray man, whiskered and immobile.  He administers the Academy
from his padded chair--ratty blanket thrown over his lap--by scratching
messages on parchment and throwing them out the window to his secretaries in
the courtyard below.

"The Academy has already sent two of our best," he says.  "They failed to
return.  We consider them lost.  You must do better."

You, a novitiate Indagator, investigate for the Academy all manner of
esoterica.  Usually the questions revolve around the finer points of philosophy
and science debated by the Scholastics.  This riddle, though--the Mark of
Cain--is monumental.  It is the oldest mystery in known history.

The Provost breaks the silence with a deep and gravelly voice.  "Indagator, you
are charged with resolving this ancient question.  Stand and prepare yourself!"

Summoning all his powers, he claps his hands--and in an instant, you are sent
back in time...to the beginning...

I. A YOUNG EARTH

East of Eden
A fine hazy mist shrouds the sky, making the sun little more than a smeary
torch in a smoke-filled room.  The air is redolent with a sour aroma.  The
world feels fresh and new.

On your wrist is the orbis bracelet given to you by the Provost before you were
sent to this time.  You must not lose the bracelet; it's your only way back to
the Academy.

Before you, a circuitous path plunges eastward into the windswept wilderness.
It is this direction you will need to travel to begin your inquiry.

Behind you, to the distant west, lies Eden.
