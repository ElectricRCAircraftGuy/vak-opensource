Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 1.0.6.





























Can you hear me? >> y

Good, you're conscious. We're conscious. I've heard urban legends about synthesis going wrong, one half person getting lost.

Do you remember our name?

>no
To review, we're Alexandra now. I was Alex, before the synthesis. You were...

>wait
...oh boy. Okay. Okay. I need you on form here. This is going to be hard if you don't remember being Andra. Not panicking. As far as I can tell, the operation was a success. We're meant to be one person now, unrecognizable to anyone who knew us before.

A Removal by Emily Short

Let's try to get a look around. I haven't been able to run our body without your help, but maybe now you're awake, it'll work better.

To get a look around, type LOOK and press return. If you do not want help getting started, type TUTORIAL OFF.

Ok.

Here's what we think we need to do: 
  Gain entrance to the Bureau
  Find Brock

We are equipped with the following essentials: a backpack, a flash drive, an invitation, your L-remover (upgraded to handle animates and abstracts), a monocle, some Origin Paste, a pan (really the smuggled plans in disguise), a roll, and a tub of restoration gel.

We are also carrying an arm, some asparagus, a banana, a cross, Guidebook to Anglophone Atlantis, a jotter, a keycard (which opens the small door), a letter, a lime, a map of Slangovia, a password, a ring (which opens the sturdy iron gate), some sage, a screwdriver, a shrimp cocktail, and some yogurt.

The flash drive and the pan (really the smuggled plans in disguise) are in the backpack, which is gaping wide open so everyone can see what's inside. 

We are wearing the monocle.
