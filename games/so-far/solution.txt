==================================

     First some hints for the different sections, the walkthrough is at the  end
     of this document.


What to do in the different sections in the game:

(hot, sticky):

     You have to find your way to the first shadow. Did you feel the  breeze  of
     air  inside  the theatre? There is another one outside the theater. Explore
     it and you will find a doorway behind the shrubs. Behind it you will find a
     cupboard,  inside which rests a box. Take it. Did you examine the cupboard?
     Did you have a look at the shadow? Enter it and you will be in (autumn,
     cool, smoky).

(autumn, cool, smoky):

     You will have to open the gate. West of the chimney you can find something,
     which will help you opening the hatches of the pillars. You should open the
     hatch on the western pillar first, because there are 3  more  pods  in  it.
     Have you tried pushing the western pillar (save your game first)? Now think
     what you can do, to open the gate. You have to oil the wheel in the eastern
     pillar  and  push  the western after it. Voila, the gate is open. Next, you
     will have to turn on the generator in the dome. If you die after  you  have
     been  in  the small chamber inside the dome, you should examine the plants.
     If you touch them and smell the vapor, you will be save for  a  few  turns.
     Now  what  to do with the blocks? Try moving them. But only as close as you
     have to. Listen carefully! If you managed that, you can  pull  the  western
     lever  at the castle to gain entrance to the balcony. The shadow here leads
     to (bright, bitter, wind), but you need something from (warm, arid,  dusty)
     before you enter it.

(mild spring, quiet):

     When you are here for the first time, there is not  much  you  can  do.  So
     search  for  another  shadow.  You will find it east from the center of the
     mall. You can only go east from the mall, if  there  is  just  one  "guard"
     standing  around.  You  will need the ceramic square. A boy will eventually
     drop it in the mall. The shadow will lead you to (warm, arid, dusty).

     If you solved (autumn, cool, smoky), (warm, arid, dusty), (bright,  bitter,
     wind), (bitter reek) and (formless) you can have a look at the animals. You
     will need a saddle and a knife. The saddle can be found in the arena, north
     of  the  dusty yard. You have to get it, when three people are cleaning the
     arena. What to do with the animals? Did you try freeing the violet or green
     one  (save  your  game  first)? What if the crested one was not tied to the
     wall? So you now have to choose the right one to ride. The green  one  does
     not like water, so put the saddle (orange thing) on the violet creature and
     enter and untie it. Whee, ok, the shadow  at  the  flagpole  leads  you  to
     (dank, black).

(warm, arid, dusty):

     You will have to get some things from the tents. You must be careful not to
     disturb  the people. Use the flattened path as it muffles your steps. Which
     things to get from the man? You will need the jar and the knife. After  you
     take  the  second thing from the man you have to get as quickly as possible
     to the shadow. Walk SE 2 times. There you are. Enter the shadow, then  come
     back.  The  angry  people  have  disappeared and you can fill your jar with
     water now.

(bright, bitter wind):

     First, find something to protect you  from  the  cold.  You  can  wear  the
     blanket,  lying  at the pole. You should not lick the pole, because you can
     only get your tongue off again, when you light it, and you have better uses
     for your light. How to come in the cave? Perhaps if you break something off
     the cliff you could reach it. Noticed that crack? Try to  pour  your  water
     in.  After  the cliff has collapsed you can enter the cave. You will find a
     shadow leading to (bitter reek).

(bitter reek):

     There is nothing to do here, just find the shadow on the west side, which
     will lead you to (formless).

(formless):

     Pay attention to the messages, which appear when you move. You will have to
     go  the  way,  where it says that you feel a faint resistance. When you get
     another message use undo and try a different direction. You will then  come
     to  a  place  where you feel an intense resistance in every direction. Wait
     for the shadows to form a ring and enter it. It leads you back  to  (bitter
     reek)  where  you now find a sphere. Notice that the sphere will change its
     form depending in which area you are!

(dank black):

     You will have to use your ears here. Notice that you can "take" some sounds
     here,  which  will  allow you to move in directions you could not, when you
     were not "holding" the sound. Note: You can also take  the  "low  plooping"
     sound, although it is not listed like the other ones. You will find a place
     of silence which you can enter. It leads to (cramped, crawling).

(cramped, crawling):

     You will need a light source here. Therefore examine  your  jar.  You  have
     something,  which  will  make  it into a light source. Right, your leftover
     pod. Squeeze it in the jar. Now you need something to light  it.  Have  you
     examined  the  square? Break it. Do not light the whole oil at once! Wait a
     moment and you notice a trickle of oil coming out of the  jar.  Light  this
     and  you will have a light source. Then you have to find out how to use the
     pipes. You have to hit them. You will eventually find a boy  here  and  you
     should  have  a  thick pipe left when you find him. If you have not, try to
     hit the pipes in another order. When you find the shadow, drop the jar  and
     the shadow will lead you to (meaningless).

(meaningless):

     When you check your inventory you will notice that your sphere has  changed
     into  a  ridged  brown  cube. You have to make it a regular colorless cube.
     When you move the cube you get information  about  what  happens  with  the
     cube, when you move in certain directions. Take the right way and your cube
     will lose its color. There you will see a ring like in (formless). You have
     to enter it (twice) and answer the question. That's it.
