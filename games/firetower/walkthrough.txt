"You're certain that you'll be okay on your own?" he asks.

You smile at him, tightening the pack around your waist. A slight laugh creeps
into your voice - it's not as if you haven't done this before. "Yes, dear. I'll
be fine. It's nothing personal, I just..." You take in the concerned expression
on his face and your voice softens slightly. "I just need a break. Not from you,
necessarily, but from everything: work, responsibilities, friends. I just need a
day to myself, you know?"

He nods. "Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do. No worries; I get like that myself
sometimes. Just in case something happens, what route do you plan to take? Your
usual?"

You nod. "Yeah. I'll head up the long way, on the Lower Mt. Cammerer trail, hit
the Appalachian trail to get to the tower, then descend by going further down
the AT towards Low Gap. I'll take the Low Gap trail back to the campground."

He smiles at you. "Like I said, 'Your usual.'  Listen, I'll be back to pick you
up about... Hm, what time?"

"Well, if I were just hiking, I could be out by mid-afternoon, but I really want

to take my time and enjoy things. I guess it gets dark about... what? Half past
nine these days?" He nods. "I should be out by then. I'll meet you right back
here at nine-thirty, okay?" you offer up your most reassuring smile.

"Sure," he says. "I love you. Be careful, and have a great hike."

With that, he kisses you lightly on the lips and gets back in the car. He waves
out the driver's side window and heads off toward the north end of the parking
lot, towards home. Soon, the car is out of sight entirely.

Standing alone at the edge of the deserted parking lot, you take in a deep
breath of fresh air and glance about. An inviting trail beckons from the forest
to the east; that path quickly curves among the hemlocks and out of sight. Two
roads depart from the parking lot: one leads north, towards home, the other
south, toward the campground not quite half a mile distant.

Today's hike is one you've done many times before, and you're intimately
familiar with the ground you'll cover. You know without the aid of a map that
you can proceed either east or south, and that either route will bring you
toward the Lower Mt. Cammerer trail. From there it's a slow and steady climb to



the fire tower.

>inventory

You are carrying:
  some socks (being worn)
  some hiking shorts (being worn)
  a shirt (being worn)
  some hiking boots (being worn)
  a hip pack (being worn and closed)
  a watch (being worn)

>look


The hiker parking area is where people generally leave their cars while
exploring the nearby trail system in the national park, but this morning it's
devoid of vehicles. A grassy hill, recently mown, lines the western edge of the
parking lot, while a forest abuts it to the east. From the parking lot there are
two roads: one departing north, toward the park exit, and one leading south
toward the campground just under half a mile away. A trail enters the woods to
the east, quickly disappearing amongst the hemlocks.

For your hike, you can proceed either east or south. Either route will take you
to the Lower Mt. Cammerer trail.

>smell

The air smells of life, of greenery and nearby streams. Lovely.

>examine sky

The sky is a rich, warm blue, and the sun is climbing in the east.

>x forest

A forest of towering hemlock hugs the eastern margin of the parking lot, and a
trail enters the woods due east.

A slight breeze blows out of the east.

>x watch

You glance down at your watch, a rather chunky and unstylish accoutrement
purchased for fifteen dollars at the drugstore. Fashion critiques aside, it's a
functional, water-resistant, glow in the dark timepiece.

At present, it indicates that the time is 7:05 AM.

>x pack

You don't know what you'd do without your wonderful hip pack on day hikes like
this. It's compact, it's capable of carrying everything you could really need
(even in an emergency), it holds a water bottle, and it's your favorite color
(green!).

>east

You decide it's best to leave the pavement as quickly as possible, and opt for
the trail into the woods. The path, lined with wildflowers, curves south, then
southeast, before joining with the Lower Mt. Cammerer trail.


You're standing at the junction of two trails, and two signs are nailed to a
single post here to orient you. The Lower Mt. Cammerer trail heads northeast,
toward the Sutton Ridge Overlook and, eventually, to the Appalachian Trail.
Alternately, the trail continues southwest toward the campground, about two
tenths of a mile away. A second trail, unnamed, runs northwest, toward the
parking area where you began, or southeast, toward the Low Gap Trail.

A patch of yellow flowers is growing at the base of the signpost.

>look


You're standing at the junction of two trails, one running northwest-southeast,
the other running northeast-southwest. At the north corner of the junction, two
signs are nailed to a single post indicating where each trail leads.

>smell flowers

Hm... you can't really detect much of a scent from these flowers. Their delicate
beauty makes up for the lack of scent.

>listen

Somewhere out of sight, a crow caws.

>touch flowers

You carefully grasp one of the jewelweed stems between your fingers so that you
can examine it better, then carefully release it again.
